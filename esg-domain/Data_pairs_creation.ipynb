Our ESG reporting covers the January 1 to December 31, 2022, reporting period. - The Novartis in Society Integrated Report is prepared in alignment with the Integrated Reporting Framework (published by the IFRS Foundation) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the latest non-financial standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). - For disclosures relevant to our sustainability-linked bond, we follow the terms and conditions as outlined within the Final Listing Prospectus, dated September 21, 2020, for the \\u201cPatients reached with strategic innovative therapies\\u201d and \\u201cPatients reached through flagship programs\\u201d ESG performance metrics. - In addition, we take certain other internal principles and guidelines into account, including the Novartis Code of Ethics. We also have established procedures for gathering, collecting, and aggregating data for the ESG performance metrics. - We apply a financial control boundary and have detailed the scope of our reporting by metric in the sections below. All Novartis legal entities within the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements are in scope for the ESG performance metrics unless otherwise indicated.\\n\\nWe aim to fully integrate any acquired entities or businesses into our ESG performance metrics data collection.\\n\\nDocument updated on January 31, 2023 - Reporting Frequency\\n\\nWe gather data internally on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, depending on the type of metric, and report publicly on an annual basis in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report. - Data sources and systems\\n\\nOur objective is to gather and report reliable and robust data. Our data reporting systems are evolving, and we continue to work to align data recording and reporting methods across our business units. Data sources and systems for each ESG performance metric are outlined in the tables below.\\n\\nMisstatements and Corrections - We make every effort to capture all information as accurately as possible. Any data that is subsequently found to be materially in error or where conversion factors may have changed, will be clearly indicated. Materiality is assessed based on judgment of what we believe would impact our readers. This data will then be restated for purposes of baselines and trend analysis. We continue to work and invest on enhancing our ESG data systems and governance to improve the quality of our data going forw - ard. - Verification / Assurance\\n\\nIndependent limited assurance is provided by KPMG over data for the current reporting year 2022 on the performance indicators on pages 81-84 of the Novartis in Society Integrated Report.

A recall can affect various countries.\\n\\nSupply chain - ESG Category\\n\\nSuppliers risk- assessed by 3rd Party Risk Management (TPRM)\\n\\nGroup Finance - Metric, Methodology, Definition\\n\\nNumber of suppliers assessed: As part of onboarding of suppliers or existing suppliers of new products, services, and sites are subject to a TPRM risk-assessment. The respective business owner fills out a questionnaire and based on the answers provided, a TPRM risk assessment is triggered according to an embedded risk matrix (type of spend and country) Unit of measure: number of risk assessments performed and closed on suppliers - The assessments are done using these risk areas: anti- bribery, animal welfare, health/safety & environment, information security & data privacy, labour rights and quality GmP (up to November 2022). Unit of measure: number of risk assessments performed and closed on suppliers by risk area - Actions taken: Depending on the outcome of the risk assessment an audit of the supplier might be triggered. In some cases, the risk assessment result requires remedial actions to be agreed and if not possible \\u2013 the supplier engagement ceases. Unit of measure: number of actions taken by type of action - Assumptions, Calculation, Data collection\\n\\nThe total number of risk- assessed suppliers is aggregated in the supplier onboarding system whereby one supplier can trigger more than one assessment depending on the risk areas involved. The same applies for new sites or new products of an existing supplier. - Scope and Exclusions\\n\\nNot all suppliers trigger a detailed risk assessment.

After exceeding our 2020 carbon emissions reduction target, we have set a vision of achieving net-zero by 2050, and we are working with the Science Based Targets initiative to determine the goals that support this vision. - From an innovation perspective, our Neptune liquid cooling technology, combined with our High-Performance Computing cluster, helps data center customers become more energy efficient. For example, they enable our customer, DreamWorks Animation, to cut power consumption by a third while increasing the amount of computing power per square foot of its existing data center by more than a hundredfold, which creates a real-time rendering process for creative artists. - Lenovo has continued its focus on resource preservation and supporting a circular economy by increasing the use of recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, increasing the use of bio-based materials, reducing the size of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and reusable packaging solutions that help to reduce carbon emissions. Since 2012, we have been using bamboo fiber in packaging, a renewable, bio-based and lightweight material. We have continued to increase our use of this material - , and are now using it in the packaging for more than one million products each year. In FY 2021/22, we expanded our use of bamboo fiber to include the ThinkPad X1 and Z series gift boxes, thus reducing the transportation weight by 30 percent. - During the last several years, the world has witnessed history quickly unfold as we live through significant complexity and uncertainty. Many of the persistent challenges that humanity has faced during this period require continued attention, including combating climate change, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19, and narrowing the digital divide. We are all learning to live with the new reality created by these challenges that continue to cause broader concerns about peace and prosp - erity for all. - We have continued to expand Lenovo\\u2019s renewable energy installation as we work to achieve our energy-related targets. The total in-operation renewable energy capacity in our worldwide locations has now reached approximately 17 megawatts, with more in the plan. - Furthermore, our efforts to effectively engage with suppliers on climate change were acknowledged when we achieved a CDP score of \\u201cA\\u201d for our 2021 Supplier Engagement Rating in Climate Change, and we were also listed on the Supplier Engagement Rating Leader Board along with a total of 518 companies. - This rapidly changing context urges the global business community to respond with smarter innovation and more responsible operations, seizing every opportunity to act with a larger purpose in mind. Business practices need to comply with laws and regulations as well as high ethical standards and moral imperatives. Lenovo is committed to our vision to provide smarter technology for all and helping to decarbonize the global economy \\u2013 one of humanity\\u2019s greatest challenges. With that, I am proud to s - hare our environmental, social and governance progress over the past year and our goals for the future. - Lenovo understands that building resiliency and mitigating the effects of climate change are efforts that require collaboration and innovation across businesses and industries. We\\u2019ve established the Lenovo 360 ESG circle with select channel partners to share joint commitments. We also offer a series of sustainable services, such as asset recovery services for products approaching the end of their lifecycle, including data removal, machine refurbishment, and sustainable material reuse. These effo - rts can help our customers achieve sustainability targets while enabling corporate citizenship as a business driver. - 4\\n\\nBuilding an Equitable and Inclusive Society\\n\\nOperating with Integrity, Ethics and Compliance - We believe technology connects people, enables productivity, and creates possibilities. Therefore, it must be inclusive and accessible to all, especially those most in need of it. Last year, we continued to respond to waves of the COVID-19 outbreaks globally. For example, Lenovo\\u2019s charitable arm, the Lenovo Foundation, partnered with nonprofits and disaster relief organizations to help fund and establish the first mobile hospital unit in Bengaluru, India to help battle the pandemic. - Lenovo has made it a priority to comply with laws and regulations and uphold high ethical standards everywhere we do business. Lenovo fully supports the call for the global tech sector to do business fairly, ethically, and transparently. We take security seriously, from product and data security, and from cybersecurity to information privacy. We believe that only with accountability and transparency will we continue to win trust from our customers and stakeholders globally. - In 2021, the Company launched its fifth annual Global Month of Service with participation from employees across 66 countries who collectively contributed over 10,000 volunteer hours to serve their communities. This annual event provided a great opportunity for employees to work closely with local schools and education centers and make a difference in many lives. The Company\\u2019s goal is to impact 15 million people by 2025 through our social partnerships and programs. - A key focus for us is supporting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education to drive positive change. Last year, I made a personal donation of RMB100 million (US$15 million) to help my alma mater, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, build a new facility with a cutting-edge High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center that will improve its computing capabilities and facilitate research and innovation. Over the next three years, Lenovo will sponsor the equivalent of RMB 200 million (US$30 m - illion) to Shanghai Jiao Tong University to support its three-year mission to drive leading scientific research, nurture new talent, and incubate new technologies. - Our ESG efforts have received the highest-ever rating and the best overall industry score for the IT industry from the 2021 Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index, reaching an AA+ rating for the first time. Lenovo has been included in the ranking since 2010, with each consecutive year marking the company\\u2019s ongoing commitment and progress in ESG. - In summary, FY 2021/22 marks another year of Lenovo\\u2019s significant progress and strong external recognition of its environmental, social and governance efforts.

Vision must be backed by meaningful actions and tangible goals. For Lenovo, our vision to provide smarter technology for all is engrained into all aspects of our business and drives our overall ESG efforts. By centering our company around our vision and aligning our commitments to it, we are reminded to continue working to build a brighter, - more sustainable future for our stakeholders and the planet. - Leading with Credibility - The disruptive toll on our planet is nearing a point of no return and there has never been greater urgency to address climate change. This heightened public concern has provoked many commitments from companies and institutions. Lenovo acknowledges the complexity of a global transition to a low-carbon economy and the amount of collaboration and innovation required. Lenovo supported the development of a standard aligned with the latest climate science and was selected to road test the Science Base - d Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard before it was launched in October 2021. We also performed an initial financial and feasibility study to size the next steps to support a path to net-zero by 2050. - I\\u2019ve witnessed many corporations respond to the unprecedented challenges of the past several years with an accelerated focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. And like many other organizations, we remain steadfast on our ESG journey as we learn to navigate the world and events that challenge even the strongest organizations. - In March 2022, we signed the SBTi Commitment Letter pledging to set net-zero targets, including a long-term science-based target by aligning with 1.5\\u00b0C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5\\u00b0C campaign. To further support SBTI\\u2019s call for corporate action, we also joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Race to Zero campaign, a broad coalition of organizations committing to set science-based targets to help build a prosperous, net-zero carbon economy - by 2050. - During FY 2021/22, Lenovo remained focused on developing innovative solutions that reshaped the way we conduct business around the world and helped to preserve the ecosystems on which our future depends. Despite disruptions, we are transforming risks into opportunities that can support our long-term growth. Even more, we are taking steps to promote a culture from the top-down to ensure ESG considerations are integrated with the business decision-making process. - Global operation comes with a global responsibility\\n\\nBusinesses of all sizes have the opportunity to build ESG commitments into day-to-day operations. However, those with a global footprint have an even greater obligation to use their size and scale as a force for good and influence those within their supply chains across markets. As a global company, we recognize our fundamental responsibilities in the areas\\n\\n6 - of ESG in the markets where we operate as we strive to integrate related values and principles wherever we conduct business. Lenovo\\u2019s Code of Conduct mandates compliance with applicable laws in markets where we conduct business, and our policies strongly support ethical and responsible business practices. - Putting Accountability at the Forefront\\n\\nFor the fifth consecutive year, Lenovo was included in the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation\\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, and received a score of 100 with the distinction of \\u201cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality\\u201d. The Index is the premier benchmarking survey on corporate policies and practices for LGBTQ workplace equality in the United States. - Developing ESG goals and initiatives that support a resilient way forward can simultaneously create long-term value for stakeholders. An effective way to achieve progress is through a collective dedication to holding ourselves \\u2013 and each other \\u2013 accountable. At Lenovo, we establish internal accountability through the ESG Executive Oversight Committee (EOC), which provides strategic direction and facilitates the coordination of ESG efforts across Lenovo. The ESG EOC is comprised of senior managem - ent from across the business and functional areas and is chartered to promote a culture that encourages strong ESG performance, including compliance and leadership activities. - For the ninth consecutive year, Lenovo received a Gold Award of \\u201cMost Sustainable Companies\\u201d from The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA)\\u2019s 2021 Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards. - As we look ahead, we will continue to leverage our strengths as we seek opportunities that improve our ESG performance and support our growth. Our genuine endeavors aim to be more than good intentions. Guided by our higher purpose, we will continue our ESG focus and demonstrate resilience by remaining steadfast on the long-term, listening to our stakeholders\\u2019 needs, and supporting our vision to provide smarter technology for all. - Demonstrating Measured Progress in ESG\\n\\nThroughout this ESG Report, we share the progress we\\u2019ve made as well as outline our goals that support our long-term vision. We are proud of what we have accomplished together, despite the many challenges. Once again, we have proven to be a united, dependable organization that rises to the challenge and conquers difficulty. In FY 2021/2022, our ESG activities reached important milestones, and some received external recognitions, including: - John Cerretani Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer Lenovo Group Limited - Lenovo was included in the 2021 CDP A list for water and received an A- for climate. CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) assesses companies on the comprehensiveness of climate and water disclosures, awareness and management of environmental risks, and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets. - September 2021 marked Lenovo\\u2019s fifth annual Love on Global Month of Service, inviting employees in 66 countries around the world to make a positive social impact in their communities. Projects were aligned with Lenovo Foundation\\u2019s mission to empower underrepresented populations with access to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.

As such, associated risks and opportunities are evaluated and prioritized annually based on its significant aspect methodology in accordance with the requirements of the Company\\u2019s EMS. Per these requirements, climate change is evaluated relative to its actual and potential influence on the environment and the business. This process is ma - naged by the Company\\u2019s Global Environmental Affairs and Sustainability team. The results of this evaluation are considered in the ERM process described above. - In 2022, the Company achieved its 1st 4-Leaf Certification from Green Freight Asia (GFA) for its performance in Australia. The Leaf-4 Label is the highest ranked label a company can obtain and demonstrates the Company\\u2019s commitment to sustainability and transparency in disclosing related data.\\n\\nClimate Change Risks and Opportunities and Management - The Company\\u2019s climate risk assessment in FY 2021/22 also included climate scenario analysis to explore how physical and transition risks and opportunities of climate change can impact its business. Its ESG materiality assessment identifies energy and emissions as material topics that it should prioritize and focus on in its environmental programs. In support of UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 \\u2013 Climate Action, one of the Company\\u2019s ESG pillars includes a climate action goal. More details - about the Company\\u2019s materiality assessment and how its goals align with the SDGs are available on page 14. - The significant risks and opportunities associated with climate change are identified and evaluated as part of two main processes within the Company\\u2019s business management systems. These include its global Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process and its annual environmental significant aspect evaluation. These two processes are connected, meaning that if climate change risks are identified in the global risk registration, they are considered in the environmental aspects\\u2019 analysis \\u2013 and vice vers - a. - 1.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s formal risk management process includes, among other sustainability factors: environmental risk categories such as environmental incidents, catastrophic weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, and other elements. Each major business unit and function is required to identify risks and assess their impacts on the Company\\u2019s strategy execution, then develop mitigation plans for select identified risks. This process is managed by the Company\\u2019s ERM team. - For more information about the Company\\u2019s identification and assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities, metrics, and actions to address climate change, please read the Company\\u2019s responses to the most recent CDP Climate questionnaire.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Company scored an A- \\u201cLeadership Level\\u201d on CDP\\u2019s Climate Change questionnaire which reflects its performance toward environmental stewardship through climate change mitigation practices in its operations and supply chain.\\n\\n23 - E x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nOther Air Emissions - The Company\\u2019s baseline environmental engineering specification prohibits the use of ozone-depleting substances in its products and manufacturing processes except in HVAC and fire-suppression equipment as permitted by law which are managed in accordance with local regulations, and intentional releases are prohibited. The Company\\u2019s EMS requires the release of chemical substances to be reported as an environmental incident, including unintentional releases. During FY 2021/22, there were no reported - incidents of refrigerant releases. The Company\\u2019s operational processes do not have significant (as defined by the Company\\u2019s SEA process) direct air emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM). In addition, the Company has no wet chemical or industrial processes that use volatile organic compounds (VOC) and thus has no point sources of VOC. Household and cleaning products that contain small quantities of VOC are used at some of its facilities but asso - ciated fugitive emissions are minimal and are not quantified. - The Company\\u2019s EMS requires sites to report environmental incidents, including waste-related incidents, through the internal environmental database. During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, no waste-related incidents were reported. In addition to internal reporting, the Company\\u2019s manufacturing facilities periodically undergo audits, some of which cover aspects of waste management. For more information on audits at the Company\\u2019s facilities, see Section 4.0. - The Company recognizes that waste management is important throughout the value chain. The Company requires suppliers to meet the Supplier Code of Conduct and the RBA Code of Conduct through contractual stipulations, both of which include waste-related provisions. The Company uses RBA audits to verify compliance of suppliers that comprise its top 95 percent of spend. For more information on these supplier activities, see Section 6.0. - The Company manages downstream impacts through a product-end-of-life (PELM) program. More information on the Company\\u2019s PELM activities can be found in the corresponding section. - WASTE\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s day-to-day operations around the globe generate nonhazardous waste and minimal quantities of hazardous waste. To ensure waste is properly managed and in an attempt to minimize environmental impact, the Company\\u2019s waste, both nonhazardous and hazardous, are separated and collected on the site of generation and disposed of through third-party waste management companies in accordance with its Site Environmental Programs Manual and applicable legal requirements. - Nonhazardous\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s nonhazardous waste includes typical office and cafeteria waste as well as packaging and manufacturing scrap at manufacturing locations.\\n\\nUnder the Company\\u2019s EMS, a global nonhazardous waste target is set annually. For the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the target was to direct 90 percent (+/-5 percent) of the Company\\u2019s nonhazardous waste to recovery operations. The results of the Company\\u2019s environmental targets are available in Section 8.0. - During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company continued to measure and monitor both nonhazardous and hazardous waste generation volumes and disposal methods through an internal environmental database. In this system, environmental focal points at its sites collect and upload monthly waste data preferably from measured data or calculations based on measured data. When no measured data is available, nonhazardous waste estimations are based on the headcount at the site and the previous year\\u2019s - monthly data from similar sites4. - Hazardous\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is waste designated as hazardous by applicable laws or regulations in a country, state, region, or locality and may include oils, coolants, organic solvents, batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and ballasts. Hazardous waste is required to be disposed of in accordance with local environmental regulations with approved suppliers.\\n\\n4 - In FY 2021/22, three offices did not report waste data due to site specific limitations.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s waste data for the current reporting period is presented in Section 7.0.

The Company has:\\n\\nImplemented a corporate Water Resiliency Policy; - Endorsed the UN CEO Water Mandate; and\\n\\nPledged alignment with SBTN\\u2019s goals and vision and contributing advice and end-user insights to the development of SBTN methods and tools as an SBTN Corporate Engagement Participant - Over 99 percent of the Company\\u2019s water is supplied by third parties. To date, the Company has not experienced any issues with sourcing water that is fit for purpose. Over 99 percent of the Company\\u2019s water is discharged back to third parties for treatment. The Company\\u2019s EMS requires sites to characterize their discharges before entering into an agreement with a treatment facility (exceptions may exist for typical sanitary waste), to not discharge constituents for which a treatment facility does n - ot have treatment capability, to update characterization when a site\\u2019s activities change, and to adhere, as applicable, to the discharge limits of local law, the treatment facility, and any associated permits. - In addition, in celebration of World Water Day 2022 and to support the importance of increased water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, the Lenovo Foundation announced a global partnership with Wine To Water (W|W), a non-profit organization committed to supporting life and dignity for all through the power of clean water. - The Company\\u2019s EMS includes annual global water targets. For the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the targets were to maintain per person water withdrawal (volumes not to exceed a 5 percent increase compared to the FY 2020/21 reporting period) and perform a water withdrawal and risk analysis of the Company\\u2019s operations. These targets were achieved through maintaining operational control of water withdrawals, local targets at select sites, and analysis of site water withdrawal volumes and local water - risk indicators determined using publicly available tools. The results of the Company\\u2019s environmental targets are available in Section 8.0. - The Company requires sites to report environmental incidents, including water-related incidents, through its internal environmental database. During the FY 2021/22, there was one water-related incident. In 2021, the Company received a violation for a lapse in a sewage discharge permit for a site under construction. As part of this, the Company renewed the permit and paid a fine of approximately US$4,000. In addition to internal reporting, the Company\\u2019s manufacturing facilities undergo periodic a - udits some of which cover aspects of WASH and water management. For more information on audits at the Company\\u2019s facilities, see Section 4.0. - During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company continued to measure and monitor water use and risk. In the Company\\u2019s direct operations, the primary use of water is for WASH services for employees, contractors and visitors in its facilities around the globe. Because the Company\\u2019s primary water use is employees, water use varies from location to location with its largest manufacturing facilities, the sites with the largest employee headcount, withdrawing and discharging the most water. The Co - mpany\\u2019s water data for the current reporting period is presented in Section 7.0. Annual Verification Statements for its total water withdrawal and discharge are available on the Company\\u2019s website. - While the Company has minimal wet processes, it appreciates the importance of adequate quantities of sufficient quality water to its supply chain partners with wet processes, particularly the semiconductor industry. The Company requires suppliers to adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct and the RBA Code of Conduct through contractual stipulations, both of which include water-related provisions.

This data can then be reported to customers or other stakeholders. The Company continues to actively search for environmentally preferable materials that can be used as substitutes and expects its partners and suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment to environmentally sound practices. See the Company\\u2019s Materials Management webpage for m - ore information. - The Company restricts the use of environmentally sensitive materials in its products. This includes the prohibition of ozone-depleting substances in all applications; the restriction on the use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention; and the elimination of materials covered under European Union (EU) Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), even beyond the jurisdictions where these - regulatory requirements exist. The Company\\u2019s implementation strategy and requirements are consistent with the requirements specified in the EU\\u2019s RoHS Directive and REACH Regulation. - ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS PRODUCTS\\n\\nThe Company supports phasing out brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PVC and is committed to driving its supply chain toward this goal. The Company continues to focus on eliminating halogens from its top-selling products and across as many commodities as possible.\\n\\nProduct Materials - The Company\\u2019s corporate-wide environmental standards and specifications require its product designers to consider environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimization of resource consumption. The Company\\u2019s priority is to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. In adhering to this precautionary approach, it supports restricting the intentional addition of materials that are potentially concerning when economically and technically - viable alternatives exist. These restrictions may also include implementing concentration limits for incidental occurrences. - The Company has made progress in phasing out halogens in many commodities across several product lines, among its achievements:\\n\\nPhasing out completely the use of BFR/CFR/ PVC in all mechanical plastic parts (such as external covers, housings, etc.) across all its products\\n\\nMost of hard disk drives, optical disk drives, solid-state drives, LCD screens, memory, CPUs, chipsets, and communication cards; and other commodities with offerings meet the iNEMI definition5 of low halogen - All commercial notebooks including PCBs meet the iNEMI definition5 of low halogen except for cables and wires, AC adapter\\n\\nAll commercial monitors meet the iNEMI definition of low halogen except for their PCBA and cables. Furthermore, some monitors fully meet the iNEMI definition5 of low halogen\\n\\n26\\n\\nAll smartphone products are free of CFR and PVC\\n\\nProhibiting the intentional addition of the following pollutants to any of its parts:\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nPolybrominated Biphenyls (PBBs)\\n\\n\\u2013 - Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs)\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nDeca-Brominated Diphenyl Ethers - In addition to the regulated materials, the Company has also identified an expanded list of materials and substances of environmental interest. These substances may be candidates for further restrictions in the future. It holds suppliers accountable for reporting the use of these materials through Supplier Material Declarations. An industry-standard IPC 1752A XML Full Material Disclosure (FMD) form, submitted via an environmental compliance analysis system, is the preferred format for confirmati - on of compliance to the restrictions and for reporting when substances in question are above the specified concentration levels. - 5 The Company supports the definition of \\u201clow halogen\\u201d electronics as defined in the \\u201ciNEMI Position Statement on the \\u2018Definition of Low-Halogen\\u2019 Electronics (BFR/CFR/PVC-Free). - The Company plans to use additional BFR- and PVC-free parts and materials across the Think and Idea family of products as acceptable alternative materials become available, working toward the goal to phase out the use of these materials across all newly introduced products. The Company continues to work with its suppliers to pilot new BFR- and PVC- free applications.

In a circular economy, products are made, used, then returned, instead of being discarded and consigned to waste. In this model, the greatest amount of value is extracted from a resource while in use. Then, at the end of its service life, the resource is recovered, refurbished, and redeployed. This drives greater r - esource productivity, makes businesses more competitive, and creates new opportunities for growth. The demand for a more circular economy has given rise to the \\u2018as a service\\u2019 or usage models seen across many industries in which the user pays for only what they need, when they need it, and returns the assets or resources when they are finished. - recycle or repurpose it. This means the device can either be refurbished and reintroduced into a new working environment, or the device\\u2019s parts can be used to repair other devices under warranty. Customers only pay for what they use, avoiding the heavy capital outlays of the ownership model, as well as escaping the burden and cost of disposal. These services are addressing the industry\\u2019s transformation to as-a-service and providing lifecycle value to the Company\\u2019s customers. - With a vision for a net zero carbon future, the Company knows the transition to a circular economy is critical. To help scale circular economy solutions in the IT industry, the Company has established a target to enable the recycling and reuse of 800 million pounds of end-of-life products by 2025/261.

The Company\\u2019s supply base is comprised of the following categories: internal manufacturing centers, production procurement, original design manufacturers (ODM), and general procurement. Production procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials or components that become part of the Company\\u2019s products. ODMs include manufacturing partne - rs who manufacture products on behalf of the Company. - General procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials and products which support the Company\\u2019s operations but do not become part of its products. The Company\\u2019s supply base is comprised of multiple tiers in which lower tiers of suppliers provide materials and parts to higher tiers \\u2013 and eventually to its Tier 1 suppliers, the suppliers with whom the Company has a direct contractual relationship. - The disclosures in this report apply to the Company\\u2019s production procurement supplier base. The majority of the Company\\u2019s spend is with production - procurement suppliers which often have ESG impact and risk. Production procurement suppliers can have social risks because they require substantial labor forces and have access to large, lower-skilled labor pools that are vulnerable to exploitation. Production procurement suppliers may generally also have environmental impacts through the energy, water, and materials required for production.\\n\\nDistribution of Suppliers - The Company recognizes there are many benefits in utilizing local suppliers, including decreased logistics costs, potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions, and the opportunity to support local economies and maintain community relationships. The Company considers local suppliers as those that operate in the same country as its significant locations of operations. In FY 2021/22, its significant locations of operations included manufacturing locations in China, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, - Hungary, Japan, and India. The Company estimates that 90 percent of production supply spend in China is with local suppliers. In other manufacturing geographies, the Company estimates that 20 percent of spend is with local suppliers. The chart below shows the geographic distribution of the Company\\u2019s 550 production suppliers in FY 2021/22: - 35 Europe\\n\\n11 India\\n\\n6 Latin America\\n\\n131 North America\\n\\nRegion\\n\\n224 Chinese mainland\\n\\n143 Asia Paci\\ufb01c\\n\\nThe allocation pie chart based on the registered legal entity of the headquarters of suppliers\\n\\n82\\n\\nSupply Chain Process Overview\\n\\nThe most capable suppliers are selected based on the best overall acquisition value - The Company considers the supply chain a vital part of its operations and views effective supply chain management as an important contributor to its success. Given this, the Company has many controls and programs in place to manage its overall procurement process. The Company recognizes that ESG risks and impacts exist among its suppliers which may differ from the ESG impacts and risks associated with the Company\\u2019s own operations. To better manage these risks, the Company has integrated several - ESG-specific controls and practices into its Master Procurement Process. - Key elements of the procurement process include:\\n\\nMaster Procurement Process - The Company\\u2019s Master Procurement Process is designed to oversee all purchase commitments for production materials and the goods and services that support its worldwide operations. With a mission to deliver the best pricing, quality, supply, technology, and service in a sustainable manner, this model provides a controlled procurement approach that is applied across the organization for commodities and includes the following elements for production and general procurement: - Business awards are reviewed and approved with proper delegation of authority\\n\\nNew Supplier Validation - New suppliers are assessed for numerous capabilities including their operational aspects, financial stability, product security, and ESG expectations. More specifically, all new suppliers are reviewed on the Company\\u2019s sustainability policies, codes of conduct, ISO certifications, ESG standards, environmental impact aspects, controls to prevent forced labor, and public reporting. Of particular concern are suppliers that may be listed as restricted or denied parties identified by governments and/o - r international agencies. The Company\\u2019s policy and formal practice is that under no circumstances shall the Company\\u2019s personnel purchase, sell, or ship any product contrary to applicable export laws or to any individual or firm appearing in any relevant government list of any party who has been denied export or import privileges. During FY 2021/22, 78 companies were assessed using this process. - Contract Management\\n\\nDelegation Authority\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s Code of Conduct includes requirements for the formal delegation which support accountability and responsible procurement practices. The \\u2018Authority to Make Lenovo Commitments\\u2019 section outlines the requirements for delegations with well-defined authority for commitments and other contract terms and conditions and, most importantly, that making business commitments outside these processes is not permitted.\\n\\nSupplier Selection - Supplier relationships are best managed when there are clear stipulations of responsibilities, deliverables, and relevant terms and conditions. The Company\\u2019s supplier contracts incorporate legal and operational agreements and address various types of engagement. Additionally, all production suppliers must comply with the Company\\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct and they are encouraged to comply with the latest version of Responsible Business Alliance\\u2019s (RBA) Code of Conduct. Compliance with the compre - hensive Supplier Code of Conduct is executed via standard purchase agreements or standard purchase orders. The Company\\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as the RBA Code of Conduct, strictly prohibit bribery and corruption. The RBA audit protocol includes anti-bribery and anti-corruption in the Ethics section. - Implementing a controlled approach to awarding the Company\\u2019s business to suppliers is critical to meet its procurement objectives and to establish a trusted base of suppliers. Therefore, even the perception of favoritism or bias is unacceptable. To ensure business awards are conducted ethically and fairly, the Company utilizes defined and approved sourcing methods to ensure the following:\\n\\nSuppliers have a fair opportunity to compete for the Company\\u2019s business - Buyers conduct an ethical evaluation on carefully understood facts such as supplier prices, terms, and conditions\\n\\nInternal Training - The Company recognizes that supply chain management is an ever-changing field. To ensure those with delegated authority are informed on current best practices, it conducts numerous communication and education activities throughout the year for its global supply chain team. Typically, the Company conducts monthly events that feature education opportunities with subject matter experts and provides on-demand targeted training. Beginning in FY 2021/22, the Company has enhanced the education program - by releasing additional online training courses, targeting a 100 percent completion rate. - 83\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni - Procurement Process\\n\\nThe Company is committed to sound ESG management across its end-to-end supply chain process. It has ESG-specific systems in place, supported by contractual requirements to help ensure that suppliers meet or exceed applicable labor, environmental, health and safety, and ethics standards. - (direct and through agencies), employee age requirements, timesheets, pay slips, environmental controls, and other documents. The auditors also conduct individual and group interviews with a random selection of employees (direct and through external agencies). During those interviews the auditors, address freedom of association and collective bargaining among other topics by having conversations with the employees regarding their rights at the facility. - The practices below align with its ESG-related internal corporate policies. The Company\\u2019s human rights commitments are codified through its Human Rights Policy and further explained in its Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. The Company\\u2019s environmental commitments are codified in its Environmental Affairs Policy, Climate and Energy Policy and Water Resiliency Policy. The portions of these commitments that apply to its supply chain extend to suppliers through its Supplier Code of Conduc - t. - The table below provides an overview of the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\u2019 annual RBA audit performance. Because suppliers are encouraged to be audited every two years, each year represents approximately one-half of the suppliers in its audit program for the given year (a total of 56 in the previous FY 2020/21).\\n\\nIn the event of supplier non-conformance to ESG requirements, including those identified by RBA audits, several actions may take place, which include:\\n\\nRBA Leadership and VAP Audits - Immediate discontinuation of business for serious violations\\n\\nThe Company started an effort to require its suppliers to commit to achieving RBA Validated Audit Program (VAP) and Factory of Choice (FOC) designations to demonstrate leadership in ESG.\\n\\nTrack audit findings to closure and required supporting evidence whenever possible\\n\\nPenalize the supplier in the quarterly supplier report card score with a sustainability multiplier\\n\\nSenior procurement management engagement with the supplier - Executive Company management engagement with the supplier - This requires significantly high audit scores, formally trained site personnel, and proof of working grievance systems. In FY 2021/22, 87 percent of the Company\\u2019s suppliers by spend achieved VAP Recognition, and almost 6 percent of the spend was designated Factory of Choice (FOC). By comparison, the numbers were 63 percent and 2 percent respectively in FY 2020/21. It is the Company\\u2019s goal that by 2024, 95 percent of its suppliers by spend will have RBA VAP recognition and 50 percent will have FO - C recognition. - In FY 2021/22, 71 RBA VAP audit reports were completed by the Company\\u2019s suppliers. According to the audit report results, none of the Company\\u2019s suppliers had findings related to the use of child labor or forced labor. - Regardless of their self-assessment risk level, the Company requires 95 percent of suppliers by spend to conduct an RBA VAP audit or an equivalent independent, third-party audit by RBA-approved auditors every two years. During these audits, independent auditors stay for several days at the supplier\\u2019s premises to review employee contracts\\n\\n84\\n\\nHistorical Average Scores\\n\\nLabor Score\\n\\nHealth & Safety Score\\n\\nEnvironmental Score\\n\\nEthics Score\\n\\nManagement Score\\n\\nTotal Score\\n\\n# of Priority findings - # of Major findings\\n\\nSuppliers\\n\\n2017\\n\\n153\\n\\n158\\n\\n181\\n\\n191\\n\\n183\\n\\n143\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n6.3\\n\\n2018\\n\\n156\\n\\n167\\n\\n184\\n\\n191\\n\\n188\\n\\n149\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n157\\n\\n174\\n\\n184\\n\\n197\\n\\n187\\n\\n153\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n157\\n\\n173\\n\\n189\\n\\n199\\n\\n190\\n\\n155\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n5.4\\n\\n2021\\n\\n158\\n\\n180\\n\\n193\\n\\n198\\n\\n196\\n\\n165\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n4.7\\n\\nODM Partners\\n\\n2019\\n\\n156\\n\\n175\\n\\n182\\n\\n197\\n\\n188\\n\\n156\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n5.6\\n\\n2020\\n\\n166\\n\\n188\\n\\n196\\n\\n200\\n\\n197\\n\\n172\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n2021\\n\\n167\\n\\n181\\n\\n197\\n\\n194\\n\\n194\\n\\n170\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n3.9 - Audit Results and Responses\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, 63 suppliers had major labor findings identified in their audits. The most common supplier audit findings are related to an industry-wide problem of excessive working hours and insufficient time off for their employees. While most of this work is done voluntarily by the employees, the Company considers these findings as significant or potentially negative - social impacts. The Company requires its outsourced manufacturers to report their employees\\u2019 working hours and time off performance monthly via an online tool so that it can take action to resolve any issues that are identified. Because agreements for improvement were reached with suppliers with significant or potentially negative social impacts, no relationships were terminated as a result of the labor findings. The FY 2021/22 results are shown below.\\n\\n14% Conformance\\n\\n14% Major\\n\\n19% Major - Excessive Working Hours\\n\\n67% Minor\\n\\n10% Minor\\n\\nInsufficient Time off\\n\\n76% Conformance\\n\\n85\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nJoint Audits with Company\\u2019s PCSD Quality Team - Child Labor\\n\\nBesides running the Company\\u2019s formal RBA Program, the Global Supply Chain Team also collaborates with the Company\\u2019s PCs and Smart Devices (PCSD) Quality Team to conduct on-site audits in suppliers\\u2019 facilities. With assistance from the Quality Team, the Company is building a new way to emphasize the importance of monitoring its suppliers. - The new joint program was launched in October 2021. In total, 81 PCSD Quality Engineers have been trained by the Company\\u2019s RBA professionals and have engaged in 80 supplier audits. These audits focus on Labor, Health and Safety. The Company\\u2019s Quality Team leads the audit by using pre-designed questionnaires and checklists developed by the ESG Team in accordance with the RBA standard. - The Company supports universal human rights including those identified in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Company commits to extending these rights to its employees and others directly or indirectly employed in its supply chain. Child labor is not to be used in any stage of business operations. The term \\u201cchild\\u201d refers to any person under the age of 15, under the age for com - pleting compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is the highest. To ensure the human rights noted above, the Company implemented multiple guidelines and actions including, but not limited to: - Human Rights Policy\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nEmployee Code of Conduct\\n\\nForced Labor\\n\\nSupplier Code of Conduct - Source Right 6.1\\n\\nThe Company is committed to eradicating forced labor in all its forms including slavery and human trafficking at every stage of business operations. It holds a firm position that there is zero tolerance for forced labor and any documented instances will be met with immediate action, including discontinuing the business relationship with any suppliers that overlook this practice.\\n\\nDue diligence and audits across the supply chain to identify risks in child labor violations - Mandatory education and certification on labor topics for buyers\\n\\nTo better detect and mitigate the forced labor risks, the Company adopts and implements preventive measures. In FY 2021/22, some of the Company\\u2019s actions to prevent this practice were:\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, there were no violations reported related to child labor at the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\u2019 RBA VAP audits. - Living Wages\\n\\nUpdated version of the Supplier Code of Conduct enhancing the management of labor agents and contractors\\n\\nUpdated version of the Procurement Source Right Code 6.1, improved with new supplier validation process\\n\\nMandatory education and certification on forced labor prevention for a total of 325 sourcing managers from all global business groups - Through the RBA audit and corrective action process, the Company drives suppliers to adhere to applicable wage and benefit laws and regulations. In FY 2021/22, the Company decided to move a step forward to extend the responsibility from the worker\\u2019s individual wellbeing to an employee\\u2019s family. The Company is participating in the RBA Living Wage work group and is exploring the development of implementation guidelines to support workers throughout the supply chain. The ultimate target of the Livi - ng Wage project team is to publish a Living Wage policy, to deliver training, and verify the baseline within its business in 2022. - A third-party ESG risk assessment tool (EcoVadis) launched to screen suppliers throughout the supply chain tiers\\n\\nQuarterly discussions with suppliers on potential red flags related to forced labor\\n\\nRegular RBA Responsible Labor Initiative/VAP workgroup engagements\\n\\n86\\n\\nEcoVadis - Responsible Sourcing of Materials\\n\\nThe Company is continuously increasing focus on sustainability in procurement. In FY 2021/22, it began to strategically expand the scope of ESG assessments to suppliers across all categories by launching the EcoVadis tools. - The EcoVadis platform aims to provide ESG ratings for a large base of suppliers, including production procurement, general procurement, and other key suppliers. The Company has implemented the EcoVadis IQ tool to screen suppliers\\u2019 ESG risk, based on their inherent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) risks and procurement information. In FY 2021/22, more than 457 suppliers were processed in the EcoVadis IQ tool, and 110 suppliers were invited to conduct an EcoVadis ESG assessment. - The Company recognizes the importance of the responsible procurement of raw materials when sourced from regions experiencing political and social conflict, which may include the conflict minerals of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or surrounding countries. Since 2012, the Company has adhered to the following efforts and expects its production procurement and ODM suppliers to do the same: - The Company continues to ensure that all strategically important suppliers participate in the EcoVadis program and achieve at least 45 of 100 points or a comparable audit result. Suppliers scoring less than 45 out of 100 points must implement a corrective action plan (CAP) and the progress will be tracked within 90 days. - The 360 Watch feature of the EcoVadis platform is another monitoring measure taken to minimize the risk of child and forced labor, or any other social, environmental, and governance risks. Negative media coverage in these areas related to a supplier will be highlighted to the Company\\u2019s management, requiring the supplier to respond within one week, and develop a corrective action plan. The 360 Watch, in addition to other indicators, enables the Company to monitor and score its suppliers on variou - s ESG focus areas, helping it to continually improve the supply base. - The intentions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \\u2018Dodd-Frank 1502 Rule\\u2019 even if not directly regulated by the U.S. SEC\\n\\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Sourcing Materials from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas\\n\\nRBA Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) program - The Company supports the efforts of the RMI to address materials beyond 3TG. In FY 2021/22, the Company conducted extensive due diligence for the Company\\u2019s cobalt supply chain using the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) and the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The Company will coordinate with the RMI as RMI performs risk profiles on other materials, assess the content in its products, and further develop due diligence efforts to mitigate supply chain risk. These efforts were init - iated through RMI\\u2019s coordination with the \\u2018Drive Sustainability\\u2019 organization which has already developed risk profiles on over 30 materials in the technology and automotive industry.

None of the RBA audits for the reporting period contained priority environmental findings; therefore, the Company did not terminate any supplier relationships in response to significant potential or actual negative environmental impacts.\\n\\nEnvironmental Impacts in the Supply Chain - The Company\\u2019s corporate-wide environmental standards and specifications require its product designers to consider environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimization of resource consumption. The Company\\u2019s priority is for its suppliers to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. Compliance to the standards and specifications is monitored as part of the Product Compliance Review Board Process. - Annually, the Company requests key suppliers to formally report environmental data related to climate change, water and waste. The Company asks that suppliers report via the Responsible Business Alliance or the CDP reporting methodologies in addition to responding to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE). Last year, the Company introduced the IPE tool to its suppliers. IPE provides a free tool to help Tier 1 suppliers assess environmental compliance in their supply chain, exten - ding the Company\\u2019s governance to up-stream suppliers. - Environmental Audit Results and Responses\\n\\nDuring the FY 2021/22 reporting period, 71 of the Company\\u2019s suppliers, representing over 50 percent of its total procurement spend, underwent RBA facility-level audits. Over the period of FY 2020/21 and FY 2021/22, 129 suppliers underwent RBA facility-level audits, which represent 95% of the suppliers by spend.

The Company\\u2019s target in this area is to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 25 percent per million US$ procurement spend by FY 2029/30, compared to FY 2018/19. Based on FY 2021/22 data, the Company is on track reducing the GHG emissions from purchased goods and services. - In FY 2021/22, the Company\\u2019s procurement team began adding an ESG standard template into its quarterly business review (QBR) with suppliers to maintain ESG as a topic of discussion\\n\\nWater\\n\\nThe Company surveys key suppliers on water-related data including performance indicators such as annual water withdrawal, water discharge, and water recycle/ reuse volumes.\\n\\nScope 3 GHG Emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (MT/per million US$ procurement spend) - Baseline (FY 2018/19)\\n\\nFY 2021/22\\n\\nTarget (FY 2029/30)\\n\\n79\\n\\n73\\n\\n59 - For the most recent supplier data collection period, the Company\\u2019s coverage of engagement was 92 percent of procurement spend. Since one of the most straightforward indicators of impact (especially to water-stressed areas) is water withdrawal, the Company has been encouraging suppliers to set up water reduction targets since 2014. During the last data collection period, 76 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with quantified water reduction goals. - Science Based Targets for Suppliers\\n\\nIn addition to setting Science Based Targets (SBT\\u2019s), the Company has been working to promote the concept of a low carbon transition with production procurement and ODM suppliers. The Company is engaging and incentivizing these suppliers to also commit to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). - Waste\\n\\nThe waste-related information collected from suppliers includes data such as annual hazardous and nonhazardous waste volumes.\\n\\nDuring the reporting period, 28 percent of its procurement spend included suppliers with formally recognized SBT\\u2019s which was an increase of 4 percent from the previous year. It is the Company\\u2019s goal to achieve 95 percent of procurement spend with suppliers that implement SBT\\u2019s. - Waste prevention is the most preferable option in the waste management hierarchy, and the Company encourages suppliers to set up public waste reduction targets. During the last data collection period, 83 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with quantified waste reduction goals.\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN DIVERSITY - Capability Building\\n\\nMany of the Company\\u2019s suppliers are large national and international suppliers. They manage their corporate ESG programs while engaging directly with the Company\\u2019s programs. In addition to its own training programs, the Company offers and provides the following: - The Company\\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program is committed to seeking and developing diverse businesses while contributing to the economic success of communities it serves. It recognizes that supplier diversity creates a win-win by influencing the inclusion of diverse businesses within its supply base which impacts brand reputation management and improves revenue performance through sales.\\n\\n90 - In FY 2021/22, the Company\\u2019s total U.S. spend across all business units with small and/or diverse suppliers accounted for 23 percent of its total expenditure in the U.S.\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, the Company also exceeded the U.S. Government Small Business Subcontract Plan target of 12 percent by achieving 16 percent of U.S. spend with small businesses over the course of the Fiscal Year. - The Company continues to partner with several non-government organizations (NGO) such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women\\u2019s Business Enterprise Networking Council (WBENC). The Company also increased support to minority businesses through the \\u201cEvolve Small\\u201d program, in collaboration with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and Toronto Regional Board of Trade. Through this initiative, the Company helped small businesses recover from the impact of CO - VID-19 by providing sixty companies in seven different markets across the United States and Canada ongoing support throughout the year. - The GSC Risk Council established a monthly collaborative platform to engage the business unit functions, leverage insight and identify synergies as the Company addresses risk management decisions. The convergence of business function leaders provides the opportunity to evaluate the impacts on the other functions and develop a consolidated business continuity plan with clear actions. - Effective risk management strategies have been a critical part of driving business performance. The Company has also recognized opportunities are created when it transforms risks into opportunities that can support its long-term growth. The Risk Council recently directed a scenario planning exercise that included identifying potential risks from the following categories:\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 - Strategy Financial Catastrophic events Human Capital Legal and Regulatory Compliance Operations Sociopolitical\\n\\nAs the Company moves forward, its success not only lies within workforce diversity but also in the inclusion of diverse suppliers that provide competitive advantages, increased innovation, and revenue that can support its brand reputation.\\n\\nBuilding Supply Chain Resilience - In 2021, the Company established the GSC Risk Council to support risk management throughout its supply chain. The GSC Risk Council\\u2019s mission is to boost the Company\\u2019s growth by implementing risk controls through industry-proven processes that can enable the supply chain to quickly adapt to demands for new technology and reduce the risk associated with the transition. Agility and resilience are critical components for a successful GSC strategy than can withstand the short lifecycle of information - and communications technology products and changing consumer demands. - After analyzing these categories, the strategy team selected the top five risks for the fiscal year. With consideration of the organization\\u2019s risk appetite and the business-driven data that was collected, the team selected the top five potential risks and conducted a comprehensive scenario planning for each risk. For each scenario, the team incorporated stakeholder feedback, identified contributing factors, and analyzed both short-term and long-term impacts. - The information derived from this planning exercise enabled the GSC Risk Council to understand the types of risks that may impact the Company and how those conditions may affect its performance, thus contributing to the development of greater strategy resilience and flexibility throughout the supply chain.\\n\\nThe GSC Risk Council\\u2019s main objectives include the oversight of:\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 -

Data excludes:\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nConsultants and vendors working through a contract agency or third-party performing services or consulting on site for a brief time and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n\\u2013 - Contractors who usually perform non-critical, non-core jobs and their employment decisions, including pay and benefits, are made by the third-party employer \\u2013 and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nSupplemental students who are interns or who are hired for a very short window of time and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n4 - Turnover rate data covers voluntary departure of regular employees for the full FY 2021/22. Involuntary turnover is planned exit of employees which is in alignment with the company strategy and decisions. Hence, as a strategic and standard practice, this is excluded from reporting.\\n\\n5\\n\\nIn FY 2020/21, turnover rates by region were transposed among AP, China and EMEA. Totals did not change but were realigned with the corresponding region.\\n\\n6 - Metrics based on FY beginning with FY 2018/19. Results were not revised.\\n\\n7\\n\\nLenovo\\u2019s total contributions in responding to natural disasters is US$8,128,720.76. This amount is tracked at the geo level. In prior reporting periods, the Company reported a separate line item for global disaster response. Beginning with FY 2021/22, the disaster response total will be integrated into the respective geographic contributions.\\n\\n8 - Increase in China giving reflects tracking of Lenovo Foundation Beijing and a US$7.8M donation in response to the Henan floods.\\n\\n9\\n\\nTotal giving in Latin America reflects tracking of the Motorola Brazil tax incentive program.\\n\\n10\\n\\nTotal contribution in Asia Pacific includes Lenovo\\u2019s commitment to the India Companies Act.\\n\\n11\\n\\nEstimated value of employee volunteer hours is calculated based off an entry level hourly wage of US$43 per hour.\\n\\n12 - Employee giving represents the corporate match from Lenovo for employees around the world, which increased in FY 2021/22 with the launch of the new Benevity platform.\\n\\n13\\n\\nTotal contribution to communities for FY 2019/20 and FY 2020/21 was defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations. In FY 2021/22 it is defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations together with Lenovo's match of global employee donations.\\n\\n14 - Product transportation emissions include key upstream suppliers representing majority of global logistics spend. Note: Upon looking into GHG Protocol standard, we decided to re-categorize this to upstream from downstream transportation (from FY 2016/17, previous years were adjusted accordingly).\\n\\n15 - The Company is in the process of improving input data for this Scope 3 category. The data reported here is the best available estimate at the time of publication. In the FY 2022/23 ESG Report, data will be restated if needed to reflect any improved input data.\\n\\n16\\n\\nEmissions from waste include nonhazardous waste, hazardous waste and wastewater from all manufacturing, R&D locations and some large offices. No product waste is included.\\n\\n17 - Purchased goods and services include suppliers covering 94% of direct global suppliers spend. The RBA Carbon and Water Reporting Tool was used for collection of supplier data. Individual supplier data is from each supplier\\u2019s most recent reporting period and not reflective of Lenovo\\u2019s FY 2021/22. Data was allocated based on revenue.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe value for FY 2018/19 is being restated to correct an error that appeared in the FY 2020/21 ESG Report.\\n\\n19 - Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include transmission & distribution (T&D) losses from Lenovo\\u2019s worldwide purchased electricity and natural gas. A World Bank database and Energy Star Performance Rating document were used for determining T&D loss rates.\\n\\n20 - Lenovo used the current Product Attribute Impact Algorithm (PAIA) notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server tool for calculating emissions of Lenovo\\u2019s typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server. The calculated results show emissions distribution by different parts and also for use, packaging, transportation, and end-of-life treatment categories. The emissions associated with use and end-of-life treatment of sold products were estim - ated on a \\u201cnarrow\\u201d baseline for the typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server multiplied by sold/shipped product volumes. - 21\\n\\nEmissions from capital goods are based on purchased capital goods in a given year. The 2012 Guidelines to Defra GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Annex 13 was used for emission factors for different type of capital goods adjusted for inflation rate and exchange rate.\\n\\n108\\n\\n22\\n\\nApproximately less than 1% of purchased energy (electricity) is estimated based upon energy use at similar Lenovo facilities with metered usage.\\n\\n23 - When totals are slightly different than the exact sum of individual numbers it is due to rounding.\\n\\n24\\n\\nBrazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, United States, Chinese mainland, Taiwan, China represent manufacturing and R&D sites in these markets. \\u201cRest of World\\u201d represents all sites managed by Lenovo\\u2019s Real Estate organization (non-manufacturing) across the world (small and large \\u2014 except the ones in regions listed above).\\n\\n25 - Renewable energy generation capacity includes electric solar panels in Hefei and Wuhan, China and Morrisville and Whitsett, NC, USA and Ullo, Hungary.\\n\\n26 - For FY 2021/22, All Areas includes all the Company\\u2019s manufacturing, research & development, and large office sites (>100 employees). In earlier FYs, some research and development and large office locations were excluded while the Company worked to increase data coverage. Small offices (<100 employees) and retail locations are always excluded from the water reporting requirements, but a few small offices voluntarily report and are included.\\n\\n27 - All water withdrawals are estimated to be freshwater withdrawals. Due to our reliance on third-parties for the vast majority of the Company\\u2019s water withdrawals, it is not possible to determine the exact parameters of all sources, but it is reasonable to assume the majority of the sources had low TDS based on local knowledge and communication with third-parties.\\n\\n28 - Areas with water stress are areas with high or extremely high baseline water stress according to World Resources Institute\\u2019s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.

Nonetheless, emissions and its effects on the globe\\u2019s temperature and air quality are multi-generational challenges that our society must and will continue to address in the long term. - One of the key drivers in\\n\\nestablishing Dynagas was to become part of and develop with the LNG transportation industry in order to contribute to lowering global emissions. Natural gas, when combusted, is the lowest emitting fossil fuel. Compared to oil, the combustion of natural gas reduces CO2 emissions by 25% and reduces 95% of NOX emissions, while nearly 100% of SOx and particulars emissions are eliminated. - We believe that natural gas is one of the few available, scalable, environmentally and financially sustainable contributors to lower global emissions today and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The efficiency, flexibility and responsiveness of the combined cycle gas powerplant makes natural gas a very important baseload provider of energy that can be complemented with renewable providers such as wind and solar, whose output is variable and dependent on factors beyond human control. - We consider it noteworthy to mention that up to the moment of the energy crisis, there was a desire by policy makers to drive up fossil fuel prices (through emission taxes, reduction of new investments in fossil fuel projects etc) in order to curb fossil demand. Today, after a period of protracted under-investment in oil and gas infrastructure, high energy prices are sending the global economy into recession. Following recent events, we can conclude that our society is not yet equipped to depart - from an available and on demand energy infrastructure primarily based on fossil fuels as - long as a workable alternative is not in place. Clearly, the change into renewable technologies is a long transition and not a switch, which will require significant technological developments, careful implementation, creative solutions and an approach that prioritizes prosperity and justice. The recent turmoil in the global energy markets has been an important reminder of this inescapable fact. - In order to make a difference to the environment, the key is to develop and improve as an industry. The shipping industry and in particular the LNG shipping industry has in fact improved its carbon footprint per unit transported dramatically during the last 15 years. The main reasons for these improvements are new developments in technology in terms of cargo containment systems, re-liquefaction systems, communications, weather routing systems, and of course propulsion systems. Even in the absenc - e of any regulatory requirements the LNG shipping and equipment industry have been responsible by continuing to develop new technological solutions. - Apart from a desire to improve the vessels emissions profile, shipowners are incentivised to contribute to continuous improvement and reduction of emissions because a reduction in fuel consumption (which yields emissions savings) also reduces the cost per unit transported and improves the vessel\\u2019s financial performance.\\n\\nThe LNG shipping industry and Dynagas have and will continue to innovate and remain focused on - lowering emissions in a sustainable manner as the path towards decarbonization becomes clearer. We recognize the importance of climate change and the need to develop sustainable solutions and we are committed in embedding the ESG factor in our business model. - Our main target in compiling this ESG report is to meet the expectations of our stakeholders considering the impact they have to our business. We are committed to operate in a socially responsible manner ensuring the safety of our people and the environment, through a transparent and an ethical behaviour. The social and governance component of ESG is of paramount importance for us, as social purpose-led goals are woven into our company\\u2019s culture. The health, well-being and development of our cre - w and employees remains our top priority as we continue to build on an already successful track record. - Despite the continuous innovation and considerable selection of modern and fuel-efficient propulsion systems, the 2050 IMO global strategy and objective brings us to the need to work with the industry to find ways of continuing to reduce the environmental footprint. - The effective management of Environmental, Social and Governance matters are fundamental and of key strategic importance to Dynagas LNG Partners LP, as we work together to develop long term sustainable practices and create value to our shareholders, business, our employees, customers, investors and the community.\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n1.

ENVIRONMENT: CLIMATE IMPACT AND EMISSIONS\\n\\nStrict environmental regulations put further pressure on the shipping industry towards decarbonization.\\n\\n2018 - The International Maritime Organization (IMO), adopted an initial strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping, targeting to reduce the total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050 and the CO2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards a reduction of 70% by 2050 (in comparison to 2008 levels).\\n\\n2019 - The European Commission published the Green Deal, which is a package of policy initiatives, to assist EU on the path to a green transition, with the aim of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 including a target to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050 over the baseline level of the year 1990.\\n\\n2020 - The IMO adopted amendments to the MARPOL convention that require ships to combine technical - Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) - and operational - Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) - measures to reduce their carbon intensity gradually by 2% annually from 2023 through 2026. - The European Commission published \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d package, targeting a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d includes four proposals which are directly related to the shipping industry, more specifically to the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the set of a maximum limit on the GHG intensity of energy used on board by a ship (FuelEU Maritime Initiative), the introduction of a minimum tax rate on the relevant fuels used for intra-EU ferr - y, fishing and freight vessels (Energy Taxation Directive) and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation to ensure that the decarbonization pathway of the transport fleet is supported by adequate recharging and refueling infrastructure in EU ports. - LNG is considered to be the cleanest fossil fuel and a \\u201cbridge fuel\\u201d in the context of the energy transition. Global shipping is turning towards the selection of LNG as a fuel towards decarbonization. The combustion of LNG fuel emits lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than coal or oil, as well as lower nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and almost no environmentally-damaging Sulphur Oxides (SOx) emissions.\\n\\nWe are committed to meet industry\\u2019s targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\\n\\n18 - 19\\n\\n5.

In order to comply with the said regulation vessels should: (i) use 0.5% sulphur fuels on board, (ii) instal scrubbers (Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems - ESGSs) for cleaning of the exhaust gases of the vessels, and (iii) retrofit vessels to be powered by liquefied natural gas. Entry into force: January 1, 2020. - Our response\\n\\nThe use of LNG as fuel is promoted as one of the most effective compliance means. All of our vessels can operate with low-sulphur fuels.\\n\\nInventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM)\\n\\nZERO\\n\\nnon-compliance with environmental laws and regulations incidents in 2021 - Regulation aiming to ensure that ships, being recycled once they reach the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health and safety Vessels of 500 gross tonnage or above, regardless of flag, will require a certified IHM on board if calling at an EU port or anchorage. Non-EU flagged vessels may also be certified against EU SRR by complying with the HKC IHM requirements. Entered into force: December 31, 2020. - Our response\\n\\nAll of our vessels hold an approved IHM certificate and Statement of Compliance. Relevant training is offered ashore and onboard.\\n\\nIEnergy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) - Amendments to MARPOL Convention introduced requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping. The requirements include a technical approach to reduce carbon intensity based on the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) which measures the theoretical energy efficiency of ships. The attained EEXI is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and a - bove. Entry into force from January 1, 2023. - Our response\\n\\nEEXI index for all fleet vessels has been calculated and verification process is underway from recognised organizations.\\n\\nCarbon Intensity Indicator (CII)\\n\\nOur response\\n\\nIMO Ballast Water Management Convention\\n\\nThe BWM Convention requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of new or invasive aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. Entered into force September 8, 2017. - Our response\\n\\nAs of December 22, 2022 we have already installed ballast water treatment system on three of our vessels, and we plan to install such systems on the rest of the fleet within 2023. - Amendments to MARPOL Convention introduced the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) in support of IMO\\u2019s strategy to reduce the carbon intensity of the shipping industry. CII is expressed in gr of CO2 per DWT-nautical mile. Ships of 5,000 gross tonnage will be required to document and verify their actual annual operational CII achieved against a determined required annual operational CII Entry into force: from January 1, 2023. - The methodology used for the calculation and reporting as well as the annual operational CII will be included in the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) Part III for each vessel.\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n5.

The total energy consumption for 2021 stood at 743,056 kJ/m2.\\n\\nElectricity Consumption (kJ/m2/month)\\n\\nEnergy consumption of our Company for the years 2020 and 2021\\n\\n82,598 - Fleet average CO2 emissions (tonnes)\\n\\n743,056\\n\\n63,328\\n\\n5%\\n\\n60,168\\n\\n657.5\\n\\nFleet average NOx emissions (tonnes)\\n\\nTotal energy consumption (kJ/m2)\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\nSimilarly, with respect to heating oil consumption, we achieved a 24% decrease in energy consumption deriving from oil.\\n\\nHeating oil consumption (kJ/m\\u00b2/year)\\n\\nEnergy consumption by our Company deriving from oil (heating).\\n\\n34\\n\\nFleet average SOx emissions (tonnes)\\n\\n27,734\\n\\n24%\\n\\n21,040\\n\\n2.7\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021 - Fleet average PM emissions (tonnes)\\n\\n26\\n\\n27\\n\\n5. ENVIRONMENT: CLIMATE IMPACT AND EMISSIONS\\n\\n5. ENVIRONMENT: CLIMATE IMPACT AND EMISSIONS\\n\\n5.2.1\\n\\nCO2 EMISSIONS\\n\\nThe total Scope 1 GHG emissions for 2021 maintained at the approximately the same levels with 2020. Our fleet recorded 495,589 tonnes CO2 emissions in 2021, and 490,352 tonnes in 2020.\\n\\n5.2.2 - SOx EMISSIONS Sulphur Oxide (SOx) emissions are directly linked to the content of sulphur in the fuels used by the vessels. Since January the 1st, 2020 came into force the decision of IMO-Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) for a reduction in sulphur emissions from vessels from 3.5% to 0.5% m/m.\\n\\nShipowners may comply with the said regulation via three options:\\n\\nI. Using 0.5% sulphur fuels on board. II. - Installing scrubbers (Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems - EGCSs) for cleaning of the exhaust gases of the vessels.\\n\\nIII. Retrofitting vessels to be powered by liquefied natural gas.\\n\\nThe total SOx emissions of our fleet increased in 2021, from 109 tonnes in 2020 to 205 tonnes in 2021.\\n\\n5.2.3 - NOx EMISSIONS Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a by-product of combustion of the engines of our vessels. We monitor our NOx emissions regularly so that we are within the limits set by the applicable guidelines and regulations.\\n\\nThe total NOx emissions of our fleet increased in 2021, from 2,352 tonnes in 2020 to 3,945 tonnes in 2021.\\n\\n5.2.4 - PARTICULATE MATTER Particulate matter (PM) emissions consist of solid particles and liquid droplets emitted in the air by the vessels. PM emissions are closely related to the type of fuel used by the ships and its sulphur content.\\n\\nFor this reason, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO has adopted amendments to the Annex VI to MARPOL seeks to further reduce air pollution by the use of lower sulphur content fuels (up to 0,5%). - The total PM emissions of our fleet for 2021 were 32 tonnes while in 2020 were 16 tonnes.\\n\\nIn 2021, the fleet, on average, experienced longer ballast voyages resulting in increased NOx, SOx and PM emissions compared to 2020.\\n\\n28\\n\\n29\\n\\n5.

Reciprocally, to reduce the production of waste on board the ship on all voyages, it is required the packaging of all supplied stores, provisions and spares to be environmentally friendly, recyclable and to be kept to a safe minimum. - Since 2001, the IMO has adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, or the \\u201cAnti-fouling Convention\\u201d. The Convention entered into force on September 17, 2008 and prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of molluscs and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. - The supply of stores in bulk (i.e. lub oils) further reduces the number of drums, wastes, etc., in this respect all relevant departments pass relevant instructions to suppliers and Master and report their responses.\\n\\nWe have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti- fouling Convention. - The waste quantities produced in 2021 by each of our LNG carriers (on board) per month in presented in the Table below.

Describe your business model (including business object, products/services) . WUQM Consulting GmbH is a management consultancy based in W\\u00fcrzburg, Germany. Since 1994, we have been advising and supporting companies and organizations in the implementation, monitoring and verification, maintenance and continuous further development of process-oriented (integrated) management systems or operational processes (measurement, monitoring and audit activities) in particular in the following areas: You can find more details on our consulting topics and services here. In addition, we offer a wide range of training courses, specialist seminars and thematic in-house training to strengthen legal certainty in companies and to develop professional competencies. . Occupational Safety and Health Protection; Data Protection and Information Security; Energy Management, Energy and Resource Efficiency; Sustainability Management, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Quality Management; Food Safety; Risk Management and Product Safety; Environmental Management and EMASeasyTM Methodology . Additional remarks: . WUQM Consulting not only offers its customers the opportunity to take a role model on the way to a more sustainable business way by supporting them, for example, in the introduction of integrated management systems, but also sets a good example. As a micro-enterprise, WUQM is not obliged to report on its sustainability commitment in the sense of the CSR Directive Implementation Act, but takes sustainability reporting as an opportunity and voluntarily reports. In 2015, WUQM Consulting introduced the integrated management system EMASplus. In autumn 2015, an external expert confirmed the standard conformity of WUQM Consulting with the EMAS Regulation and EMASplus. The registration certificate was handed over to the company by the IHK W\\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt in spring 2016. WUQM Consulting's commitment to sustainability also includes the signing of the sustainability code of the event industry, which is a fair obligation for the organisation of its own events and seminars. Since 2017, WUQM Consulting has also been an official DNK training partner and contributes to the German sustainability code's promotion of sustainable business through the provision of information events and training courses. For more details, please refer to our sustainability report with an integrated 2015 environmental statement and our updated 2017 environmental statement. . 1. Strategic analysis and measures . The company discloses whether it pursues a sustainability strategy and explains what concrete measures it is taking to operate in accordance with the essential and recognised industry-specific, national and international standards. . In 2015, WUQM Consulting applied the process-oriented methodology Ecomapping\\u00ae and EMASeasyTM and introduced the integrated sustainability management system EMASplus to meet the standards of the EMAS Regulation, the EMASplus Directive, ISO 14001 and ISO 26000. Important elements of this methodology are the analysis of the essential social, environmental and economic aspects of business practices, their opportunities and risks, as well as the development of a program with defined measures, responsibilities and objectives based on an FLIPO matrix with integrated sustainability assessment of the individual activities of the company. To complement the FLIPO matrix, WUQM Consulting's team also carried out a SWOT analysis, which identifies strengths and weaknesses for the company's future viability. Derivation of appropriate measures is currently in progress. A more detailed description of the methodology and the individual analysis steps can be found in the Sustainability Report with an integrated Environmental Statement 2015 and in the updated Environmental Statement 2017. . 2. Materiality . The company discloses which aspects of its own business activities have a significant impact on aspects of sustainability and the significant impact the aspects of sustainability have on its business activities. It analyses the positive and negative effects and indicates how these findings are incorporated into its own processes. . WUQM Consulting sees itself as a pioneer for sustainable business \\u2013 on the one hand through its advisory services to companies and organizations, and on the other hand through its assumption of responsibility for the social impact of its own business activities. Therefore, a key sustainability aspect is the consistent alignment of decisions with the corporate guidelines and the definition of concrete annual targets. The latter are stated in the 2016-2018 improvement programme (see updated Environmental Statement 2017, pp. 9-14). The improvement programme lists the measures implemented and planned for the sustainability aspects identified as relevant in the FLIPO matrix: 1) Positioning of WUQM Consulting as a pioneer and model for other companies and organisations 2) Promoting employee motivation and satisfaction 3) Promoting customer satisfaction 4) Environmentally friendly design of events 5) Establishment of an environmentally friendly mobility behaviour 6) Establishment of an environmentally friendly and fair procurement 7) Promotion of employee health 8) Establishment of transparent and environmentally friendly waste management In accordance with the company guidelines, WUQM Consulting strives to promote environmentally friendly and socially appropriate action in order to strengthen the sustainability of companies and organizations. In order to implement this claim in its own company, WUQM Consulting always takes into account its impact on the environment and society in its decisions and business practices. The company supports sustainable value creation in the region by preferably cooperating with local suppliers, service providers and organizations. By exchanging and actively engaging in regional, nationwide and international projects, networks and cooperations, the existing competencies are optimally introduced and expanded. This principle also applies to its own employees, whose motivation and satisfaction is increased, for example, by the targeted promotion of their strengths. The basis for this is a cooperation based on honesty and trust. . Objectives . The company discloses which qualitative and/or quantitative as well as time-defined sustainability goals are set and operationalized and how their level of achievement is controlled. . WUQM Consulting has defined goals in its 2016-2018 improvement programme (see updated Environmental Statement 2017, pp. 9-14) as part of the EMASplus integrated management system for each sustainability aspect and assigned them to achieve targets. An annual update is carried out, which guarantees a continuous optimization process involving all employees. The monitoring is carried out by the sustainability officers (internal audits, continuation of improvement program, team meetings, reporting) and the management (management review). Environmental indicators for reviewing the achievement of targets are analysed in an input-output analysis ( Electricity and heat, mobility, material consumption, energy consumption, water and wastewater, waste, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants) were recorded. By means of an environmental verifier (external audit), WUQM Consulting was officially confirmed by the EMAS Regulation (integrated into ISO 14001) and the EMASplus Directive (integrated into ISO 26000) at the end of 2015 and the corresponding certificates or certificates were handed over by the IHK W\\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt. Details on the quantitative and qualitative objectives, the state of implementation of the measures as well as the input-output analysis can be read in the Sustainability Report with integrated environmental declaration 2015 and in the updated environmental declaration 2017. . 4. Depth of the value chain . The company specifies the importance of sustainability aspects for value creation and to what depth of its value chain sustainability criteria are reviewed. . WUQM Consulting provides its value creation mainly in consulting or through training courses in the areas of energy, environmental and sustainability management as well as occupational and health protection. The company offers customers throughout Germany, but primarily within a radius of 200km from its own location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The resulting frequent travel activities have a high environmental relevance. To minimize the negative environmental impacts through mobility, the preferred means of transport is the railway. The employees are provided with the BahnCard 50 for this purpose. If it is not possible to travel by train, reasonable carpoolings will be formed. Two e-charging stations were installed on the company's parking spaces and a plug-in hybrid vehicle leased for the management in December 2016. Furthermore, the possibility of leasing e-bikes, the reimbursement of costs for public transport and the development of a business travel policy is planned for 2017. Another important point for the added value of WUQM Consulting is the provision of information and training events. By moving to new office rooms on the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areal (the buildings under the protection of monuments have been built according to current EnEV- Since autumn 2015, WUQM Consulting has been providing its own seminar room. The events are conducted in accordance with the sustainability code in a fair manner. Most of the materials are digitally made available to participants on USB stick to save resources. If this is not possible, WUQM Consulting will only use recycled paper (Blauer Engel) to print the materials. In addition, an expansion of the event portfolio to include digital offers is planned for the future. For internal office supplies, a procurement policy sets environmentally friendly and fair standards for the purchase of office equipment, IT-based equipment and equipment. Equipment and food pre-orders are ordered almost exclusively from environmentally certified partners (shippers, printing companies, etc.). WUQM Consulting is very strongly involved in regional networks for the exchange of experience, the establishment of best practice examples and the use of synergy effects to promote the regional business location Mainfranken (supporting the environment Unterfranken e.V., advisory network Mainfranken, model Hohenlohe, BVMW Mainfranken, energy efficiency initiative Unterfranken, etc.). . 5. Responsibility . The responsibilities in corporate management for sustainability are disclosed. . The overall responsibility for the management system lies with the management board, Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig and Dr. Michael Zoller. The sustainability officer, Tina Heinemann, was qualified and appointed for the introduction, maintenance and further development of the integrated management system. The managing director Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig is a specialist for occupational safety (SiFa) and is responsible for risk assessments, instruction, ergonomics at the workplace and all questions relating to occupational and health protection in the office and field service. The second managing director Dr. Michael Zoller is responsible for the implementation of internal data protection. Legally, WUQM Consutling is not obliged to appoint a data protection officer, but the company benefits from these additional qualifications. . 6. Rules and processes . The company discloses how the sustainability strategy is implemented through rules and processes in the operational business. . In order to implement the defined business guidelines, the integrated management system EMASplus was introduced. This ensures the continuous improvement process of WUQM Consulting towards a sustainable economy. The individual tasks and responsibilities in the management system are documented in an internal responsibility matrix. The entire team of WUQM Consulting is actively involved in the implementation, further development and maintenance of the integrated management system. This is done through processes such as the Ecomapping\\u00ae methodology, the identification and evaluation of the relevant sustainability aspects in the FLIPO matrix, the development and continuation of the improvement program with defined responsibilities, the proposal for measures and the implementation of internal audits. In the operational business, sustainable practices are defined e.g. by the following guidelines and the signing of codes: . Directive on eco-fair procurement for office materials, IT products, cleaning products and occupational clothing, electricity supply, heat supply through biogas, food and beverages, and event management (introduced 01/2016).; Business Travel Directive for the promotion of public transport/rail transport and e-mobility (Hybrid vehicles, e-bikes) (planned until 07/2017).; Sustainability Code Fair Obligation of the Event Management (signed 07/2015) ; Training Partner of the German Sustainability Code: WUQM Consulting has been offering consulting services in the areas of sustainable management, environmental and quality management, energy and resource efficiency, risk management and the qualification of managers and employees for more than 20 years. Since 02/2017 WUQM Consulting has been supporting companies and public institutions through training on the application of the DNK. . 7. Control . The company discloses how and which performance indicators are used for sustainability in regular internal planning and control. It explains how appropriate processes ensure reliability, comparability and consistency of data for internal control and external communication. . With the introduction of the integrated management system EMASplus, an input-output analysis on the data base of 2014 was prepared for the first time. In the updated environmental statement 2017 the key figures of 2014, 2015 and 2016 are shown. However, comparability and use of the data for internal control is not possible so far, as WUQM Consulting changed its location in 2015. Currently, especially environmental key figures are collected. The balance sheet is to be extended over the years by sustainability indicators from the social and economic area. About the sustainability report with integrated environmental statement 2015 and the updated environmental statement 2017 the sustainability commitment of WUQM Consulting is presented externally transparent, credible and comprehensible. . Performance indicators for criteria 5 to 7 . Performance Indicator G4-56 Describe the values, principles and standards of conduct and conduct (codes of conduct and ethics) of the organization. . Corporate Guidelines; Sustainability Code Fair Obligations of the Event Industry; Eco-fair Procurement Directive; Business Travel Directive to promote the use of public transport/rail transport and e-mobility (in planning); Registration as a certified company according to EMAS and EMASplus . Incentive schemes . The company discloses how the target agreements and remuneration for managers and employees are also oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and long-term value creation. It is disclosed to what extent the achievement of these goals is part of the evaluation of the top management level (CEO/CEO) by the supervisory board. . In half-yearly employee discussions with the management, individual goals are defined and evaluated, how the employee can optimally participate in the long-term added value of WUQM Consulting, depending on the competence, and what contribution the employee can make to the continuous improvement process of the environmental management system. Both are carried out in accordance with the company guidelines. An incentive system represents the employee's profit participation on the basis of a performance-related premium model, which is also designed individually. If the company generates a surplus, the employees are involved in this in the form of a distribution. As a micro enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting does not have a control body (supervisory board/counsel) for the management. . Performance indicators for criterion 8 . Performance Indicator G4-51a Compensation Policy \\u2013 Report on the remuneration policy for the highest supervisory body and senior executives. . As a micro-enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting does not have a supervisory body (supervisory board/advisory board) for the management. No key figures are collected for the remuneration policy of the management. . Performance Indicator G4-54 Specify the ratio of the annual remuneration of the highest paid employee in each country with significant business activities to the average level (median) of the total annual remuneration of all employees (excluding the highest paid employee) in the same country. . As a micro-enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting has only one location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The indicator has not yet been collected. . 9. Participation of Stakeholder Groups . The company discloses how social and economically relevant stakeholders are identified and integrated into the sustainability process. It discloses whether and how a continuous dialogue with them is maintained and how its results are integrated into the sustainability process. . In the course of a workshop, the WUQM Consulting team identified the diverse stakeholder groups that are directly or indirectly affected by the company's decisions or have claims to the company. A stakeholder map shows the degree of concern (intensity of communication, claims and influence) of the stakeholder groups (see Sustainability Report with integrated Environmental Statement 2015, p. 9). The dialogue with the customers (permanent and project customers) is maintained through the implementation of the services of WUQM Consulting (consultations, trainings, audits, etc.) and by means of a questionnaire for satisfaction with the services provided. The feedback of the customers finds influence in the employee discussions and in the meetings of the management. The competencies, needs and goals of the permanent employees are examined in half-yearly employee discussions with the management and taken into account in the company planning. For the integrated management system there is an internal proposal system, which is used as a pool of ideas for measures to improve the sustainability performance of WUQM Consulting. Communication to governmental institutions and regional stakeholders is carried out on a discontinuous basis and if necessary, e.g. for the implementation of joint events. The suppliers of WUQM Consulting are limited to few, environmentally-oriented and partly also certified providers. There are usually very long-term and trusting business relationships. Supporting stakeholders are cooperation partners, networks, business associations, regional organisations and local neighbours. The above-mentioned forums and stakeholders serve WUQM Consulting for the exchange of experience, for the use of synergies, for project generation and as multipliers for the offer and commitment of WUQM Consulting. For a more targeted participation of the identified stakeholders is provided a team workshop for the analysis of the needs of the stakeholders and their integration into the sustainability process. . Performance indicators for criterion 9 . Performance Indicator G4-27 Name the most important issues and concerns that have arisen through stakeholder involvement and how the organisation has responded to those important issues and concerns, including through reporting. Name the stakeholder groups that have addressed the key issues and concerns. . Extension of the EMAS environmental management system to include the EMASplus sustainability management system, in particular the integration of social concerns into the management system; application of the sustainability code in a fair manner when carrying out own events; health management with specific offers for our own employees (in planning) . In the personal contact with customers and via the questionnaire on customer satisfaction, the customer's concerns are brought to us. Here, in particular, extensions or individualizations of our services are made. However, the customers and partners of WUQM Consulting are also important drivers for the own management system. WUQM Consulting has implemented the following: The following were realized from the ideas and suggestions of the employees via the internal proposal system: . Initiation and implementation of EMAS certification; conduct of a coaching for the management and employees for team building as well as for the optimization of the internal organization and workflows; possibility of leasing e-bikes for employees (in planning); compensation of CO2 emissions for a climate-neutral business operation (in planning) . 10. Innovation and product management . The company discloses how it contributes through appropriate processes to improving the sustainability of its own resource use and users through innovations in products and services. It also explains whether and how their current and future impact is assessed in the value chain and in the product lifecycle for the essential products and services. . everyday contact with customers from different industries in positions relevant for sustainable development (sustainability, environmental, energy, quality management, data protection officer, etc.) in companies and public institutions; intensive regular exchange in networks, forums, working groups and convoys; continuous training and further training of employees . WUQM Consulting is always open to external impulses and suggestions and strives to take up innovative products and current social developments in its work. It plays a pioneering role, for example, by introducing the integrated EMASplus management system, by ensuring fair compliance with the sustainability code and by using a plug-in hybrid vehicle by the management. WUQM Consulting has the necessary access to the relevant and up-to-date information: With the introduction of environmental, quality or sustainability management systems, it strengthens the sustainable management of organizations. Positive effects are achieved through long-term change and improvement processes. Clear savings targets are set, among other things, in the areas of waste, energy, emissions and continuous work on improving environmental performance. All customers, e.g. EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme), publish an externally tested environmental declaration in which the ecological effects of their services and products are described and are documented with indicators. In the spring of 2014, WUQM conducted the study \\\"EMAS - Satisfaction and Exploitation of EMASplus, Environmental Psychological Results Evaluation on the basis of a Customer Survey\\\" in cooperation with a Research and Development Office. 28 companies were asked about their satisfaction with EMAS and the EMASeasy methodology and their potential for expanding the existing environmental management system to a sustainability management system. All companies developed and implemented an ambitious environmental program. Above all, the employee involvement by the EMASeasy methodology was rated as particularly positive by 89 percent. Whether the final environmental explanation was of benefit and was asked for was affirmed by 70 percent. As other positive effects, transparency, encouragement for savings, improvement of the quality standard as a whole or an increase in environmental awareness among employees were mentioned. . Performance indicators for criterion 10 . Performance indicator G4-FS11 Percentage of financial assets subject to a positive or negative selection test according to environmental or social factors. . This indicator is not relevant due to the current business situation and position. . 11. Utilization of natural resources . The company discloses the extent to which natural resources are used for business activities, including materials as well as the input and output of water, soil, waste, energy, area, biodiversity and emissions for the life cycle of products and services. . In 2014, WUQM Consulting prepared an input-output analysis for the first time and has continued it annually since then. The balance sheet contains several environmental indicators that document, among other things, the resource consumption of WUQM Consulting and, if necessary, the improvement of environmental performance: Basic data Input Output The exact consumption data and specific environmental indicators can be found in the updated 2017 Environmental Statement. . Useful area: heated net floor space in square metres; employees: number of full-time equivalents, share of women, share of full-time jobs, share of permanent contracts . Electricity and heat: annual consumption of electricity and heat, total consumption of electricity and heat, electricity and heat per square meter and per employee, share of renewable energy in total consumption; mobility: fuel consumption in litres and miles per vehicle per year, energy consumption of the mobility processes; material consumption: paper consumption by sheet number (translated into DIN A4) and weight in kg, paper consumption per employee, energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 100% recycled paper; water/waste water: hot water in cubic metres, cold water in cubic metres, total water consumption, water consumption per employee and working day . Waste: waste generation by type of waste (paper/cartonage, plastic packaging, residual waste, biowaste) by weight, waste generation per employee, recycling rate total; greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants: CO2 emissions in kg CO2 equivalents from electricity, heat and paper consumption as well as mobility, total CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions per employee, air pollutants in kg CO2 equivalents from heat and mobility . 12. Resource management . The Company shall disclose the qualitative and quantitative objectives it has set for its resource efficiency, in particular the use of renewable energies, the increase in raw material productivity and the reduction of the use of ecosystem services, the measures and strategies it pursues, how they have been or are to be fulfilled in the future and where it sees risks. . The corporate guidelines stipulate that WUQM Consulting takes into account the impact of its actions on the environment and assumes its social responsibility in its corporate decisions. This implies a careful use of natural resources, which is reflected in the following measures: . Company headquarters: move to a former brewery in W\\u00fcrzburg with offices in the historic brewhouse of B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u (renovation in 2014 to EnEV standard), equipped to 100% with energy-efficient LED lighting; from 01.01.2018: conversion to 100% green electricity, laying of environmentally friendly floor coverings from recycled material and renewable raw materials; resource and energy-saving practices in everyday office life: exclusive use of recycling paper (blue angel), pre-setting of the printer to double-sided SW printing, use of batteries (no batteries), refill and reusable packaging (e.g. hand soap, glass bottles, sodastream) as well as use of cloth towels in the sanitary rooms, equipment with flow limiters on taps and water-saving buttons on toilets, separation of waste into four fractions (paper, plastic, residual waste and biowaste), switching of electrical equipment with socket strips outside working hours; implementation of the Directive on eco-fair procurement with minimum criteria and waste. a. for the new purchase of products (office furniture, office materials, IT equipment, food and beverages, cleaning products, occupational clothing etc.); sustainable mobility (objective 2017: 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2014): use of the railway as a primary means of transport for business trips (measurement: BahnCard 50 with 100% green electricity for all employees), leasing of a plug-in hybrid vehicle for the management, installation of two e-charging stations at the company parking spaces, possibility for employees to lease an e-bike, reimbursement of travel costs of the \\u00d6PNV ticket for employees for the work journey, introduction of a business travel directive (2018 in planning); sustainable event management (\\\"Green Meetings\\\"): implementation of events according to the sustainability code fair, i.e. as paper-free design (scripts on USBStick), extensive organic catering of suppliers with regional and seasonal offer, extension of the seminar portfolio with webinars (2018 in planning) .

Until now, the consumption of electricity and heat has been collected for this indicator. Due to delays in the calculation of ancillary costs, the current data for the year 2016 are not yet available. They will be added soon after their receipt. With the move to the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areal in W\\u00fcrzburg in November 2015, a change of the electricity and heat supplier took place. Currently, WUQM Consulting is still bound to a framework contract of the project development company of the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areals. At the beginning of 2018 the transition to 100% green electricity is planned. In the complete renovation of the listed building and the office premises, energy efficiency measures were in the foreground. For the heating of the rooms, a low-temperature floor heating system is used, which is supplied via a central gas combustion plant. In summer, the office spaces can be cooled over the floor by approx. 2 \\u00b0C. . Performance indicator G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption. . Refurbishment according to the ENEV standard in 2014; installation of insulating glass windows; low-temperature floor heating and cooling, which is supplied with heat via a central gas combustion system . As a result of the relocation in autumn 2015, it is not yet possible to make a comparison between 2014, 2015 and 2016 and to make savings on concrete measures or indicators. The new building has other structural requirements: The following measures to reduce energy consumption were implemented with the move to the new premises: . Installation of 100% LED lighting; procurement of energy efficient appliances: refrigerator and dishwasher class A++, energy-saving induction stove . Performance indicator G4-EN8 Total water abstraction by source. . Water and wastewater --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . Hot water -- tc-- m3 -- tc-- 3.0 -- tc-- 2.9 -- tc-- k.A. .

Water consumption per employee -- tc-- m3 -- tc-- 3,4 -- tc-- 3,1 -- tc-- 1,2 . For the indicator hot water consumption, there are no data available for 2016. These are supplemented as soon as they are available. According to the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (Sustainable Building Assessment System), the average consumption for office and administrative buildings is about 20 to 30 litres per working day and employee. At WUQM Consulting, consumption has so far been around 19 litres per working day and employee. Thus, this is just below the average. . Performance indicator G4-EN23 Total weight of waste by type and method of disposal. . The data for the collection of the key figures on waste generation have been estimated since 2016 on the volume of waste containers and the frequency of their emptying. The waste is separated into four fractions (paper/cartonage, plastic/packaging waste, residual waste and biowaste) and collected in a common waste collection room on the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u site. The waste is disposed of in specified cycles via the collection system of the city cleaners, an EMAS-certified own operation of the city of W\\u00fcrzburg. Dangerous waste does not occur in office operations. The large amount of paper and cardboard in 2015 is due to the move in November 2015. . Waste generation --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . Residual waste -- tc-- kg -- tc-- 31 -- tc-- 31 -- tc-- 47 . Organic waste -- tc-- kg -- tc-- -- -- tc-- -- -- tc-- 50 .

Recycling rate --tc-- % --tc-- 88 --tc-- 93 --tc-- 87 . 13. Climate-related emissions . The company discloses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol or standards based on it and sets its own emission reduction targets. . WUQM Consulting produces emissions through professional mobility, indirectly through the consumption of electricity and heat, and indirectly through the consumption of office paper. We have achieved the target of reducing CO2 emissions from mobility by 15 percent (i.e. by 1,8250 kg) by the end of 2017. CO2 emissions from diesel consumption have fallen continuously since 2015 and amounted to only 9,449 kg of CO2 (approx. 3,000 litres) in 2017, compared with 12,172 kg in 2015 (approx. 3,900 litres). This means a saving of 2,723 kg (22 percent) of CO2 emissions. This goal was achieved by: Avoiding business travel through video and telephone conferences; bundling of business trips, use of the railway, replacement of a diesel vehicle by a plug-in hybrid in January 2017. The railway kilometres have therefore increased from 10,639 km (2016) to 29,128 km (2017). Despite the growing business, the performance of the two company cars has decreased from 63,000 km (2014) to 50,220 km in 2017. The goal of reducing indirect emissions from paper consumption is to save paper and use of 100% recycled paper with the Blue Angel. The basic settings of the printer are pre-set in black and double-sided. Customer correspondence is predominantly digital. Advertising for own events and seminars is also predominantly digital. Despite the growth in personnel and increased number of in-house seminars, indirect emissions from paper consumption with 38.6 kg of CO2 remained almost the same compared to 2015 with 38.1 kg of CO2. In 2014 and 2015, no indirect CO2 emissions were generated by the purchase of electricity from 100% hydropower. For the heat consumption from heating oil, values of 10,422 kg (2014) and 9,732 kg (2015) were generated. From 01.11.2015, the WUQM has acquired new office space and heats the rooms by means of economical low-temperature floor heating with natural gas, thus achieving enormous CO2 savings. 2015: Consumption of 30,413 kWh, CO2 emissions: 9,732 kg CO2 2016: Consumption of 5,580 kWh, CO2 emissions: 1,400 kg CO2 The purchase of 100% green electricity from renewable energies is very important for WUQM and will be implemented in the coming months. Further reduction targets and measures for 2018/2019 will only be developed in March/April and will be published in the next validated environmental statement in May 2018.The calculation of greenhouse gas and air pollutants volumes is not based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), but on the Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems (GEMIS) and the sustainability calculator of the Pro Recycling Paper (IPR) initiative. . Performance indicators for criterion 13 . Performance indicator G4-EN15 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1). . Emissions --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 .

Further indirect CO2 emissions from WUQM Consulting result from the consumption of office paper (100% recycled paper, Blue Angel). The sustainability calculator of the Initiative Pro Recycling Paper (IPR) is used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions. . Performance indicator G4-EN19 Reduction of GHG emissions. . A concrete environmental goal is to reduce CO2 emissions from mobility by 15% by the end of 2017 compared to 2014. In order to achieve this goal, internal measures were carried out to promote cycling, public transport and the use of rail as a primary means of transport for business trips. In addition, a plug-in hybrid vehicle was leased by the management in January 2017. At the end of 2017, data on possible savings in CO2 emissions and other air pollutants are available for the first time. According to the environmental balance of Deutsche Bahn, the following savings were achieved by WUQM Consulting through journeys by rail instead of journeys by car between 01/2016 and 12/2016 (assuming rail and car journeys are identical from mileage): .

The company reports on how it complies with nationally and internationally recognised standards on employee rights and promotes the participation of employees in the company and in the company's sustainability management, which goals it sets itself, which results have been achieved so far and where it sees risks. . A goal defined in the company guidelines of WUQM Consulting is to promote the motivation and satisfaction of employees. The basis is the compliance with the applicable legal regulations for occupational health and safety in Germany, as employees are insured under German labour law and WUQM is only active nationally. Important here are above all the occupational safety law, the mother protection law, the workplace regulation with all relevant workplace directives (especially for VDU workplaces) and the occupational safety regulation. The internal safety specialist (currently: Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig) keeps the risk assessment, operating instructions and other legally required documents up-to-date and carries out the annual employee training on occupational health and safety. In addition, we have been EMAS certified since April 2016 and also meet the requirements of the EMASplus guideline. The EMASplus sustainability management system has a holistic understanding of corporate social responsibility and takes into account environmental aspects (through compliance with the EMAS regulation and the UM- Standard ISO 14001) also provides economic and social aspects. The guideline is based on the internationally recognized CSR guide ISO 26000 on corporate social responsibility. Its seven core topics are organisation management, fair business and business practices, human rights, consumer concerns, work practices, involvement and development of the community. To ensure good and fair work practices, half-yearly employee discussions are held. For more information see Sustainability Report 2015, p. 27. In weekly team meetings, an exchange is held on the current projects and the available resources of the employees. Within the framework of the sustainability management system EMASplus, annual internal audits and every two years external audits are carried out by an EMAS environmental expert. The internal team, led by the sustainability representatives, initiates new objectives, the improvement programme and the continued development of the management system. In the monitoring of the sustainability performance of WUQM Consulting, there are so far only few indicators on economic and social aspects. . 15. Equal opportunities . The company discloses how it implements national and international processes and what goals it has to promote equal opportunities and diversity, occupational safety and health protection, participation, integration of migrants and people with disabilities, adequate pay and agreement of family and work, and how it implements them. . WUQM Consulting aims to achieve an honest and regular exchange with its employees (see company guidelines). This will be implemented in particular in the context of six-monthly employee discussions with the management. In this context, the framework conditions such as workload, organisation, qualification, responsibility as well as an appropriate remuneration are discussed. Employees' salary wishes are accepted and evaluated in terms of their feasibility. As there are no fixed remuneration structures for corporate consulting, the quality of our services must convince the customer in order to be able to manage successfully. On the part of the management, the aim is to pay employees appropriately and fairly in order to bind professionals to the company in the long term. This is implemented by a performance-related salary model, with which employees are involved in the company's success. This means that they receive a performance premium in addition to their net salary at the end of the financial year. There is no difference between gender, appearance, origin, religion or view of values. Qualified applications from abroad are particularly taken into account in order to offer employment opportunities to people of other backgrounds. However, this has first occurred. All employees are employed full-time for an unlimited period and full-time as desired. A flexible flexitime model and the possibility of mobile work facilitate the reconciliation of family and work for the employees. Men and women are treated equally and work on projects largely independently. The proportion of women in projects is 50 percent. For the health promotion and prevention of back pain, three height-adjustable tables have been created, which allow for a change between standing and sitting work. Access to office spaces is possible for people with disabilities by means of elevator. . (ii) the need to improve the quality of training; . The company discloses the objectives it has set and the measures it has taken to promote employability, i.e. the ability to participate in the working and professional world of all employees, and to adapt it to demographic trends, and where it sees risks. . Each employee is entitled to three training days per year. A competence matrix for the WUQM Consulting team is used to optimize the internal work organisation. The permanent recruitment of the personnel underlines the strategy of the management to develop and maintain employees in the company in the long term. The continuous training and rapid self-responsible project cooperation brings positive effects both for the company and for the employees. WUQM Consulting employs employees with different vocational trainings and from different age groups. In the field of health, preventive approaches are mainly pursued. In this way, height-adjustable tables have been procured, which enable employees to work flexibly in sitting or standing. The development of a health management system is currently being planned. . Performance indicators for criteria 14 to 16 . Performance indicator G4-LA6 Type of injury and rate of injury, occupational diseases, days lost and absence and total number of work-related deaths by region and sex. . WUQM Consulting is part of the consulting industry and agency services industry and is not exposed to any increased risk due to industrial accidents or physically heavy work in accordance with the statutory accident insurance (VBG).

WUQM Consulting has introduced a binding guideline for eco-fair procurement, which defines minimum criteria for product properties in terms of environmental friendliness, recyclability and disposal, as well as for manufacturers and suppliers in terms of compliance with general human rights and environmental, occupational and health protection. For guidance, reference is made to trusted labels, certifications and product declarations, e.g. Blue Angel, Fairtrade, GEPA and GEPA fair+. Memo AG is our main supplier of office materials, which mainly refers to its goods from Germany and Europe and carries out an extensive audit of environmental and sustainability aspects prior to inclusion in the assortment. .

By mid-2018, WUQM Consulting intends to carry out a comprehensive supplier assessment with regard to sustainability criteria. If the assessment indicates that the negative effects in the supply chain are to be feared, appropriate measures will be taken. . G4-HR11 performance indicator Significant actual and potential negative human rights impacts in the supply chain and measures taken. . Since WUQM Consulting is a consulting company, human rights implications in the supply chain may be relevant for the procurement of office and IT equipment as well as for food. In order to fulfil its social responsibility, WUQM Consulting has introduced a guideline for eco-fair procurement and signed the sustainability code in a fair manner for the event industry. . 18. Community . The company shall disclose how it contributes to the community in the regions where it carries out essential business activities. . As a consulting company for the introduction of quality, environmental and sustainability management systems, WUQM Consulting supports customers throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. However, companies or public institutions within a radius of approx. 200 km are mainly advised from the W\\u00fcrzburg location. Seminars, workshops and information events are offered in line with the business fields. WUQM Consulting is a long-standing member of the Environmental Protection Association Unterfranken e.V. (FUU e.V.), whose first board is the managing director of WUQM Consulting, Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig. promotes sustainable business in the region of Lower Franconia through projects, working groups and seminar events.

A large number of different newsletter services inform the executives and the sustainability representatives about the current legal situation. The managers and the employees also attend training courses and events each year in order to keep their knowledge up to date. Relevant changes, which lead to the need for action for the WUQM, are evaluated and communicated annually by the Sustainability Officers, in the context of update training. Important legal changes or new ISO standards are discussed during the team meetings. Compliance with occupational health and safety is ensured by the managing director Dr. M\\u00fcssig, who is a qualified safety specialist. He updates the risk assessment and carries out the annual training. The legally compliant data protection is ensured by Dr. Zoller (data protection officer) and regularly controlled. Each employee is obliged to comply with the legal framework. The legal compliance of the management is reviewed annually by an internal audit and evaluated in the management review.

In autumn 2019 \\u2013 almost exactly 120 years after the company\\u2019s founding \\u2013 we launched the biggest growth and innovation initiative in the history of Miele. The goal of this programme is to guide our independent family-owned company into the future from a position of strength. Exam- ples include a new organisational structure, a focus on new growth fields and advances in our digital expertise. Just a few months later, however, we faced an entirely different development: the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Miele has consistently focused on pro- tecting its employees as the top priority in coping with the challenges the pandemic has brought. To keep operations up and run- ning as far as possible at the same time, comprehensive protective measures were taken and maintained rigorously. Large parts of office operations were shifted to remote work from one day to the next. Almost all contacts with retailers went digital. The fact that we were able to conclude the year 2020 very successfully in eco- nomic terms in spite of the circumstances shows once again that trustworthy brands and outstanding quality serve as important anchors, providing stability even \\u2013 and espe- cially \\u2013 in times of crisis. But of everything we are grateful for, the biggest thanks go to our more than 20,000 employees. Since the start of the pandemic, they have been working under trying conditions, whether due to loss of earnings from shorter working hours or from additional stress caused by school and day care closures. As an expression of our gratitude for everything they have coped with and all their hard The Executive Directors from left: Dr Stefan Breit, Dr Reinhard Zinkann, Olaf Bartsch, Dr Markus Miele, Dr Axel Kniehl CONTENTS 33  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES work, all employees worldwide received a voluntary one-off bonus of 40 percent of one month\\u2019s pay in December 2020. on this road, we reached carbon neutrality across all Miele locations in 2021 by acquiring high-quality CO2 compensation certificates. For the past 120 years, we at Miele have been guided by our founders\\u2019 maxim \\u201cImmer Besser\\u201d, adhering firmly to this idea even or especially in turbulent times. The past year was no exception, and we did not let up in our efforts to reach our sustainability goals. Quite the opposite, in fact: In October 2020, the Executive Board adopted a much more ambi- tious sustainability strategy, defining a new climate action strategy with ambitious climate targets in the process. As one of these aims, we are striving to reduce our CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 50 percent compared to 2019 levels by the year 2030. Miele is guided in these efforts by the central aim of the Paris Agreement, limiting global warming to signif- icantly below 2\\u00b0C \\u2013 or 1.5\\u00b0C if possible \\u2013 as compared to the pre-industrial era. The sci- entifically based confirmation of our climate targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (STBi) in the summer of 2021 has once again emphasised this. As the first step If 2020 has taught us one thing, it is that global crises cannot be resolved by taking a wait-and-see approach. Instead, they call for decisive action. That is also true of climate change, which poses a wide range of risks to Miele as a com- pany with worldwide value chains. But climate action is not the only area where we have set new goals for ourselves. In terms of our products, too, we plan to fur- ther sharpen our focus in the future on not only durability and efficient use, but also aspects such as recyclability, repairability and resource efficiency. At the same time, we need to explore new market opportu- nities through business models that are both innovative and sustainable. And last but not least, we are further expanding our work on digital responsibility in an effort to strengthen our customers\\u2019 trust in our increasingly digitally connected products. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Our work on sustainability reflects our pledge to uphold the ten universal prin- ciples of the UN Global Compact, which we joined back in 2004. This report out- lines the progress we have made in the past two years. We hope you find it inspiring. Miele & Cie.

Miele aims to continuously delight its customers with unparalleled quality, innova- tive technology, perfect results and timeless elegance, while also playing a pioneering role in energy efficiency and environmental protection. \\u201cImmer Besser\\u201d, the prece- dent set by the company founders, sums it up. The owners and Executive Board feel an obligation towards the employees, cus- tomers, suppliers, the environment and society. Miele embodies partnership-based conduct towards its business partners, an em ployee-focused corporate culture as well as continuity of values, goals and leader- ship. The family-owned company is now in its fourth generation, with the two founding fami- lies Miele and Zinkann holding 100 percent of the shares. This ensures independence from the interests of external investors. In the core domestic appliance business, the company focuses on the Miele brand and its positioning in the premium segment. Digital products and services from the Smart Home division play an increasingly important role. INNOVATION AND GROWTH INITIATIVE In 2019, Miele began fundamentally reposi- tioning its organisation. The goal is to further expand on its leading market position in the premium segment in domestic and commer- cial appliances while also safeguarding the economic efficiency of the entire Miele Group on a lasting basis. The restructuring of worldwide sales activities is also among the biggest innovation and growth initiatives in the company\\u2019s history, with the focus shifting to aspects such as markets with high potential, like China and North America. Beyond that, Miele is also ramping up its investments in the company\\u2019s digital exper- tise and has established a site in Amsterdam focusing on digital marketing and digital sales. To strengthen corporate responsibility within the organisation, Miele has pooled together its operational business in eight independently operating business units (BUs): Laundry, Dishwashing, Cooking, Refrigeration, Professional, Customer Service, Small Domestic Appliances (SDA) and the recently created New Growth Factory. It opens up new fields of business with bright prospects for the future. COMPANY HEADQUARTERS G\\u00fctersloh has been the headquar- ters of the Miele Group since 1907. EXECUTIVE BOARD The Executive Board consists of five Executive Directors with equal voting rights. These include two Executive Directors who act as representatives of the families of owners, as well as three Executive Directors with divi- sional responsibility who are not associated with the families.

The chain ends with recycling or disposal of the appliances. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUPPLY CHAIN New business models and digital solutions are helping Miele open up new markets. However, this can also lead to new challenges regarding sustainability. Increasingly complex supply chains and an increasing scarcity of raw materials require more supply chain transparency. However, partnership-based supplier relationships and a shared commitment to respecting human rights and greater environmental protection offer opportunities. PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION PRODUCTION SALES & TRANSPORT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Increasing energy and resource efficiency in production is helping offset higher energy and material costs. For companies with a high level of vertical integration, the shortage of skilled workers also presents a risk. It can have a negative impact on productivity. Employee satisfaction is a decisive factor in meeting this challenge. Transport-related emis- sions are at the centre of public debate. In addition, the number of regulations is increa- sing. Logistics must be made more environ- mentally friendly. EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES USE RECYCLING & DISPOSAL Shifts in the market can have a positive or negative impact on the demand for sus- tainable products. The promotion of sustain- able consumption is an essential opportunity. Around the world, raw materials are becoming scarcer and their costs are rising. This requires comprehensive measures in order to conserve natural resources. Durable and recyclable products make a positive contribution, as does the increased use of recycled materials.

It is intended to serve as a model for all employees in their daily activities. Long-term objectives form the framework to this end. In 2016, Miele there- fore set out 15 strategic targets that are to be achieved by 2025. The company has already made significant progress on the path to completion. When it comes to climate action, for instance, energy con- sumption continued to fall at all locations in 2020. At the same time, Miele suc- ceeded in significantly reducing its CO2 emissions by cutting Scope 1 and 2 emis- sions by 40 percent compared to 2019, to name just one example. When it comes to resource conservation, the company deci- sively pursued the goal of making Miele appliances leaders in sustainable product design and integrated efficiency, allowing Miele to further increase the percentage of products sold with the highest energy effi- ciency ratings. Customers also continue to see Miele\\u2019s sustainability performance as very good worldwide, according to studies such as the 2020 \\u201cGr\\u00fcne Marken des Jahres\\u201d (Green brands of the year) survey by the international market research insti- tute YouGov and the magazine stern. In the study, consumers voted Miele number one in the category of electronic appliances. At the same time, Miele is aware that global challenges such as climate change have grown even more intense in recent years. Digitalisation and rising consumer expec- tations also result in new topics that need to be addressed. As a result, Miele car- ried out a large-scale project during the reporting period to ensure an even more ambitious approach to tackling indi- vidual topics of the sustainability strategy. This is especially true when it comes to climate action, environmental protection, the sustainability of Miele products and a responsible approach to digitalisation. STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT In the reporting period, Miele launched its global Design2Excellence > innovation and growth initiative to further strengthen the company\\u2019s competitiveness and future via- bility on a sustainable basis. The further development of the Miele sustainability strategy also counts towards this goal. Miele is doing justice to the high value of sus- tainability for the company and the brand through very ambitious new targets. At the same time, sustainability is being anchored even more firmly within the organisation and given a higher profile in the way the First place in the \\u201cGr\\u00fcne Marken des Jahres\\u201d consumer study in the electronic appliances category. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS company presents itself, including in how it communicates with customers. The revised strategy concentrates on three fields of focus: climate action, sustain- able products and packaging, and digital responsibility. These areas are ones in which the company can make a signifi- cant additional contribution to sustainability. Moreover, they are of particular relevance and urgency from a social perspective. From 2021, the targets and measures in the fields of focus will be further refined and specified in a sustainability programme. By drawing up their own sustainability programmes on the basis of the central strategy, the business units \\u2013 along with relevant central departments such as pur- chasing, human resources and logistics \\u2013 will be involved closely in implementing the enhanced sustainability strategy. FIELD OF FOCUS: CLIMATE PROTECTION Containing climate change and adapting to its impact are among the most pressing issues of our time. As a family-owned com- pany with worldwide value chains that is aware of its responsibility, Miele attaches particular importance to this global 12  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 challenge. That is why the company devel- oped a comprehensive climate action strategy during the reporting period and defined ambitious targets to support it. The strategy was adopted by the Executive Board in October 2020. At its core is avoiding, reducing and offsetting CO2 emissions. of Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint is attributable to these Scope 3 emissions, making it the key to > reducing emissions. Despite the vast complexities, Miele is taking a sys- tematic approach to this challenge and setting itself a goal in accordance with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative in this area as well. When it comes to the targets, Miele is guided by the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to significantly below 2\\u00b0C \\u2013 or 1.5\\u00b0C if possible \\u2013 as com- pared to the pre-industrial era. To ensure that Miele\\u2019s climate targets make an effec- tive contribution to achieving this goal, the company joined the internationally recog- nised > Science Based Targets initiative (STBi) in January 2021. Its membership is associated with an obligation to pursue a science-based emissions reduction target. One of the first interim goals is to achieve CO2 neutrality at all locations in 2021 as relates to the company\\u2019s own emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions attributable to energy suppliers (Scope 2). At the same time, Miele aims to reduce these emissions by 50 percent compared to 2019 by 2030. To do so, the company will make investments with a focus on improving the > energy effi- ciency of Miele\\u2019s locations and production plants while expanding the in-house gener- ation of electricity from renewable sources. In the medium and long term, the goal is also to significantly reduce CO2 emis- sions during the use of products, as in the past, and during the purchasing of goods and services (Scope 3). A substantial share FIELD OF FOCUS: SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING The second field of focus looks at Miele\\u2019s products and the way they are packaged. As the aim here is to further improve their sustainability scorecard, the tasks at hand include closing material cycles through the > use of recyclates or by improving the ability to repair products, to name just two exam- ples. The latter contributes to the exceptional durability of Miele products, which has proven to be > valuable from an ecological per- spective. Increasing resource efficiency is another item on the agenda. The goal is to ensure supply security for Miele in the long term while preserving reserves of raw mate- rials for future generations. Miele plans to lay the groundwork for achieving this goal during product development. With regard to the > packaging used in shipping, a project team is tasked with continuously reviewing alter- native materials so that Miele can continue switching to more environmentally friendly solutions. Miele also strives to use recycled or recyclable materials more often for the packaging of cleaning and care products. In addition, the company is working on new sus- tainable > business models that are designed to open up additional market opportunities. In order to achieve its climate targets, Miele also opts for generating its own electricity from renewable sources.

Miele therefore further developed its strategy in the fields of data protection and information security in the reporting period. Part of those efforts includes drawing up a \\u201cdigital product promise\\u201d that ensures the ability of consumers to use the digital functions of Miele products securely and in the long term. The relationship between the key topics and the SDGs is also indicated by the size of the circles on the materiality matrix. As part of the > further development of the sustainability strategy, Miele reviewed the find- ings of the analysis with regard to their current relevance and decided that they remained applicable. The matrix therefore continues to provide guidance for defining the focal points of Miele\\u2019s sustainability approach. CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS MATERIALITY [GRI 102-46/-47] Miele performs materi- ality analyses to determine the focal points of the sustainability strategy and reporting. In the process, the company looks into the potential impact of its business activities on sustainable development and gauges the expectations of external stakeholders in relation to the company. The most recent comprehensive > materiality analysis was performed in 2018. The global reference framework of the analysis was based on the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustain- ability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analysed topics were subsequently compiled and pre- sented in accordance with the standards of the GRI in a > materiality matrix. The hori- zontal axis of the materiality matrix presents the influence of external factors (outside-in), while the vertical axis presents Miele\\u2019s impact (inside-out) on the topic in question. In this report\\u2019s subchapters, Miele describes how the material topics are managed and what kind of progress the company made during the reporting period. In 2015, the United Nations adopted > 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are at the heart of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Devel- opment. The SDGs aim to address some of the most urgent global challenges from a sustainability perspective and reduce extreme poverty. Miele is expressly committed to the SDGs. The family-owned company makes a contribution to sustainable develop- ment through SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 in particular.

This applies equally to the produc- tion of Miele appliances and to their use and disposal, and also includes the company\\u2019s supply chain. Miele manages issues such as the conservation of resources, human rights, occupational safety and climate protection through an effective organisational structure using certified management systems. Compli- ance management ensures that applicable laws and Miele\\u2019s own guidelines are always observed. SYSTEMATIC SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT responsible for advancing the sustainability strategy in close cooperation with the Execu- tive Board, was expanded and renamed Corporate Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs (SRA) in 2021. Its renaming is an important signal within the company as to the important role of sustainability today and in the future. Along with many other departments, TPE was also responsible for implementing and moni- toring the sustainability strategy. The department heads at the company\\u2019s headquar- ters and the heads of the business units, as well as the heads of the sales regions and the heads of the sales subsidiaries, are responsible for ensuring that the objectives are achieved. Miele performs a systematic comparison of the objectives and key figures on sustainability performance on an annual basis. SUSTAINABILITY ORGANISATION Central sustainability management committees Executive Board Sustainability Board controls and decides Initiatives develop overarching solutions for focus topics [GRI 102-18/-20] Sustainability is ultimately the responsibility of the five-member Executive Board. The Board specifies the strategic direction, adopts objectives and defines indicators for measuring progress.

By reorganising the central Sustainability Com- mittee, Miele is working towards one of the main targets of the enhanced sustainability strategy: anchoring sustainability even more firmly throughout the company. Unlike in the past with the Sustainability Committee, the entire Miele Executive Board is accordingly represented on the new Sustainability Board, where it comes into contact with the heads and representatives of all relevant areas. The heads of the busi- ness units also belong to the Sustainability Board. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS [GRI 102-12/-16] A variety of principles and international guidelines to which Miele is committed form the basis for sustainability management: Corporate philosophy: prescribed principles, for example from the areas of quality and product safety, environmental protection, energy management, employee and cus- tomer orientation, or regarding specific sustainability aspects. These principles apply to all employees. Code of conduct of the > German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers\\u2019 Association (ZVEI) for socially responsible corporate management Code of conduct of the European Com- mittee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers > APPLiA (formerly CECED) for corporate social responsibility Code of conduct as part of the Association for Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics (BME) > compliance initiative to reduce compliance risks in the supply chain During its existence, the Sustainability Committee met at regular intervals, most recently convening four times in 2019. The committee dealt with the latest regulatory developments and discussed the resulting requirements for Miele. Examples include the EU regulation on energy consumption labelling, the European Strategy for Plastics and Germany\\u2019s National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights. Due to the further development of the sustainability strategy, the Sustainability Committee did not hold any official meetings in 2020. Instead, the Executive Board and the relevant areas were involved in the development process at different intervals. The committee also helped to oversee the process of imple- menting the sustainability strategy at plant level. Responsibility for doing so was handed over to the Sustainability Board in December 2020. To this end, the heads of the business units, specialist areas and the sales organi- sations report to the Sustainability Board. Ethical guidelines for purchasing: These are applicable to all employees who work in procurement. Fair, transparent and partner- ship-based cooperation with suppliers is always paramount.

It combines all the tools and standards for adhering to various sustaina- bility requirements (see > table). The integrated management system is regularly reviewed in internal and external audits. The latest cer- tificate for quality, environmental protection, energy management and occupational health and safety was issued on 15 December 2020 and is valid until 14 December 2023. The FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS certificate for social standards is valid until 25 July 2022. The employees who are responsible for the individual areas of the management system report regularly on their progress to the Executive Board. In addition, the relevant departments at the locations in G\\u00fctersloh and Bielefeld have also been certified according to the ISO 13485 standard for quality management of med- ical products. The certifications in line with the SA8000 social standard will be succes- sively renewed for all locations by July 2022. 90 internal and external audits were conducted as part of quality management in 2020. 17  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Overview PRODUCTION SITES G\\u00fctersloh Arnsberg Bielefeld B\\u00fcnde Euskirchen Lehrte Oelde Warendorf B\\u00fcrmoos (Austria) Bra\\u015fov (Romania) Dongguan (China) Uni\\u010dov (Czech Republic) Ksawer\\u00f3w1) (Poland) MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Products Tools and standards Washing machines, washer dryers, electronic components, foundry Cooker hoods Dishwashers for domestic and commercial purposes, washer-disinfectors, vacuum cleaners Steam ovens, hob units, warming drawers Electric motors, cable feels, fans Laundry machines, rotary ironers Cookers, ovens, Dialog oven Plastic parts Metal components Electronic components Vacuum cleaners Washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers Production FACTS & FIGURES ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment), ISO 45001 (Occupational safety), SA8000 (Social standard) ISO 50001 (Energy) 1) The new location in Ksawer\\u00f3w gained certification in May 2021.

The certification of the European company locations involves a matrix certification procedure. The Dongguan location plans and organises its certification independently, but remains closely interlinked with the Miele management system and the MES. In all cases, external auditors check the processes that are relevant to the certification. In 2020, 29 external integrated management system audits were performed. That figure stood at 36 in 2019. No non-conformities were found in either year. Miele Material Group Management MGM INTERNAL PROGRESS REVIEW Employees [GRI 412-1/-2] In addition to external auditing, Miele operates an internal auditing process. As a self-monitoring system, it allows Miele THE MIELE SUCCESS SYSTEM The integrated management system is inter- connected with the Miele Success System (MES) in many places. Consisting of four elements, the MES standardises and optimises processes. The proprietary IMNU 2.0 product development system, for example, allows Miele to maintain an overview of all key development aspects, from pre-development to series maturity. IMNU 2.0 includes an > environmental checklist. In the Miele Value Creation System (MWS), on the other hand, resource conserva- tion is anchored as a central design principle, with defined targets for considerations such as the durability of operating materials or the allocation of resources. Moreover, the Quality Core Processes (Q-KP) help to ensure func- tional production processes that are free of disruption and keep errors to a minimum. With the aid of Material Group Management (MGM), Miele reviews sustainability aspects, among other things, throughout the entire procure- ment process as part of targeted supplier audits and other tools.

In 2019, 98 audits took place, identifying two non-conformities related to energy management and occupa- tional health and safety. In response, Miele took both immediate and long-term measures. SUCCESSFUL RISK MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-11/-15] As a global company, Miele is exposed to a wide range of different risks. At the same time, developments in the company\\u2019s environment offer many opportu- nities for its business activities. Identifying and assessing non-financial risks plays a pivotal role in risk management at Miele. The company performs careful anal- ysis to identify the areas along the value chain where negative effects on people and the environment could occur. In addition, Miele checks to see where rising sustaina- bility requirements for the company could negatively impact its business development. Risk management uses a two-level system at Miele that is composed of central representa- tives for risk management and decentralised risk managers within the company\\u2019s oper- ating units. The central risk management team coordinates the overall process of identifying and assessing risks by potential loss and probability of occurrence. It is also responsible for taking appropriate risk management measures. The decentralised risk managers report regularly on the risks they identify and take measures to avoid and mitigate them. SUSTAINABILITY: KEY CHALLENGES [GRI 102-11/-15, 201-2] The greatest sustaina- bility risks for Miele lie in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate goods, as well as in climate change. As a manufacturing company, Miele is dependent on the availability of certain raw materials. However, the consumption of limited natural resources continues to rise constantly worldwide. A potential scarcity of raw materials is therefore a significant sustainability risk for Miele. The adverse effects on the environment that are associ- ated with the extraction and processing of raw materials \\u2013 as well as the later use and disposal of the products \\u2013 pose a problem, as they could lead to the loss of biodiversity and increasing soil degradation, to name just a few examples. Such effects also have a direct impact on the financial situation of companies, for instance in the form of rising material costs. Against this backdrop, Miele is developing a variety of approaches to reduce the need for primary raw materials and conserve natural resources in the process. The principle of circularity (circular economy) is also of growing importance. Due to a lack of regulations and legal precedence, how- ever, its implementation is complicated. With its durable and > recyclable products, Miele is already making a positive contribution to resource conservation today. The greater use of recyclates and the manufacturing of particularly energy- and > resource-efficient products help to meet key sustainability targets related to the creation of a circular economy. Miele expects the trend towards increasingly complex supply chains to gain strength, which will make it even more difficult to create transpar- ency and avoid bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials and components. Such developments will also further complicate compliance and monitoring with regard to environmental and social standards along the supply chain. The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated the complexity of the supply chain and the resulting difficulties. Despite these challenges, Miele is committed to labour and human rights standards along the supply chain, as well as to compliance with the principles of sustainable corporate management. To this end, the company performs regular > supplier audits and requests certifications from its business partners in order to mitigate supply chain risks. At the same time, the company maintains supplier relationships based on a spirit of partnership and works with its suppliers to navigate the wide-ranging requirements. This partnership-based approach ensures transpar- ency and increases reliability. Climate change is a further material sus- tainability risk for companies. The scientific community almost unanimously expects global average temperatures to rise by 2.5 to four degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically curbed. Extreme heat waves and rising sea levels already threaten natural resource ecosystems today, with a loss of pros- perity (including water and food shortages) a FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS potential reality in the long term. For companies like Miele, such effects could lead to tempo- rary or lasting interruptions in supply chains, or even the loss of locations. Besides the direct impact, climate change could also be asso- ciated with indirect risks due to factors such as regulatory requirements and changes in customer behaviour. Moreover, liability risks in connection with claims for compensation could become a burden. In light of these dan- gers and the challenges for humanity as a whole, Miele supports the 1.5-degree target of the United Nations and has joined the Sci- ence Based Targets initiative in order to develop > science-based climate targets. The company is focused on durability, as well as energy- and resource efficiency. Special emphasis is placed on the utilisation phase of its appli- ances, in which the environmental and climate impact is particularly pronounced in relation to the overall effect of Miele\\u2019s activities. More effi- cient, lower-CO2 logistics is another focal point. Miele plans to conduct a climate impact assessment to enable it to reliably evaluate the effect of climate change on its own business activities, as well as the resulting economic consequences. In the reporting period, Miele initially concentrated on identifying and prior- itising further measures to reduce CO2 emissions and improve data transparency. Since January 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant new sustainability risks for Miele, particularly in the field of occupational health and safety. > Various measures have been introduced at all locations to protect the company and its employees from infection with Covid-19. 20  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-16/-17, 206-1] Fair and cooperative conduct vis-\\u00e0-vis all internal and external partners is part of the corporate culture at Miele. Employees worldwide are obliged to abide by the law at all times, and to comply with internal guidelines, as well as self-imposed ethical and social standards. The Miele Code of Conduct was introduced in 2008 as a reflection of this obligation. It was most recently reviewed and updated in 2020. The Code, which is available on the Miele intranet, contains provisions on how to prevent bribery and corruption, as well as policies on proper conduct in relation to conflicts of interest, donations and sponsoring. It man- dates strict adherence to competition and antitrust legislation. In the reporting period, as in the years before it, there were no antitrust proceedings against Miele. > The Code of Conduct is based on the corporate philosophy, the ethical guidelines for procurement, the principles of the UN Global Compact, the SA8000 social standard and the APPLiA Code of Conduct (formerly CECED). Since 2011, Miele has been a member of the > BME compliance initiative, thereby underscoring its obligation to introduce processes for compliance and sustainable business practices at the company and implement them in its own supply chain. Compliance with individual aspects of the Code of Conduct, such as receiving and offering gifts, or how to deal with conflicts of interest, are reviewed in internal audits. In the event of violations, the company will agree on corrective measures. As a rule, however, it is the responsi- bility of the functional managers to put appropriate guidelines in place to ensure that their employees\\u2019 tasks are always carried out in compliance with applicable laws, internal rules and the self-imposed ethical and social standards. RAISING EMPLOYEES\\u2019 AWARENESS OF COMPLIANCE [GRI 102-17, 205-2, 412-2] It is mandatory for relevant groups of employees to participate in an online compliance training programme on the Miele Code of Conduct. This includes managers, as well as employees for whom the contents of the Miele Code of Conduct and the issue of compliance are particularly important. Such members of staff work primarily in the purchasing, internal audit, sales/field sales and specialist sales depart- ments or as customer services. New employees are automatically informed that they have to complete the programme. The programme is also open to all interested employees from other areas. To date, 4,122 employees participated in the online compliance training programme. 4,122 people worldwide have taken part in the training programme on the Code of Conduct, 409 of them during the reporting period. Since the end of 2016, employees at all locations involved in issues relating to competition and antitrust law are obliged to use this self-learning software on the subject of competition and antitrust legisla- tion. The programme ends with a test. Records are kept on whether tests were passed. There is also a legal management system for the areas of environmental protection, energy and occupational health and safety, and an information management software system addressing product-related regulation worldwide. OMBUDSPERSON AS A POINT OF CONTACT IF SUSPICIONS ARISE [GRI 102-17, 205-3, 419-1] Since 2010, employees have been able to turn to an external, independent ombudsperson \\u2013 or to their supervisor, HR management, internal audit, the works council or the Executive Board \\u2013 if they suspect corruption, fraud or theft within Miele\\u2019s sphere of influence. This option can also be used to report topics pertaining to human rights or data protection aspects. Employees, suppliers and third parties all over the world can take advantage of this service. The ombudsperson is addi- tionally available to provide advice on individual questions. All employees throughout the world, and all suppliers in Germany, are informed about the existence of the ombudsperson and their contact data FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS upon starting work or entering into a relation- ship with the company. If appropriate, suspicions are passed on to the central Auditing department for evaluation and review. The entire process can be handled anonymously upon request. No notifications relating to sustainability aspects were made to the ombudsperson during the reporting period. There were no instances of contracts with business partners being terminated or failing to be extended due to corruption- related violations. 21  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Stakeholder engagement Dialogue on an equal footing [GRI 102-40/-42] Miele\\u2019s products and pro- duction processes have different impacts on people and the environment. At the same time, the success and reputation of the company is also strongly influenced by the percep- tions, expectations, needs and decisions of its stakeholders. That is why Miele participates in > ongoing dialogue with all relevant stake- holder groups, including employees, customers and business partners, as well as associ- ations and interest groups, scientists and researchers, the general public, policymakers and legislators. Continuous stakeholder dia- logue helps the company to identify important trends and new developments, as well as risks and opportunities, at an early stage, and also to achieve common sustainability objectives. STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-42/-43] Stakeholder dialogue takes place on many different levels at Miele. > Corporate Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs (SRA), formerly known as the Technical Product Management and Environmental Office (TPE), plays a pivotal role in this respect. It maintains numerous contacts with experts and other stakeholders and is active in associations, conferences and dialogue forums at EU level, which enables it to help shape policy dialogue. Other areas of the company also maintain close contact with the stakeholders that are relevant for them. Corporate communications speaks to media representatives and the public, while customer service and marketing are in con- tact with customers and business partners. Experts from the specialist departments, such as energy management or purchasing, as well as members of the Executive Board, take part in conferences, working groups and dialogue forums. Visitors to the Miele locations also give the company valuable feedback. At international locations, the dialogue is generally the respon- sibility of the sales subsidiaries, in consultation with the appropriate specialist departments at the company headquarters if necessary. On account of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible to involve stakeholders in the usual manner in the reporting year. Visits to Miele\\u2019s sites were more or less impossible, and most events with external participants had to be cancelled. Alternatively, a selec- tion of digital exchange formats were offered.

The company talked to representatives of Germany\\u2019s Federal Min- istry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the Federal Min- istry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and the consumer advocacy association Ver- braucher Initiative e. V. Miele employees were also able to access an interview with climate researcher Mojib Latif on the intranet. With over 2,000 views, the echo was positive. VALUABLE FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS [GRI 102-43] Miele also conducts brand posi- tioning surveys several times a year. In these surveys, customers are asked a variety of ques- tions, including how well they believe Miele is meeting its ecological duties and what they think of the company\\u2019s commitment to sus- tainability. Between 2019 and the first quarter of 2021, Miele Brand Health Tracking, which is responsible for brand development, analysed some 54,000 interviews in 15 European coun- tries. In the interviews, customers were asked to evaluate the sustainability efforts of nine compa- nies from the industry. Miele took second place, just behind the top-ranked business and with a substantial lead over the third-placed company. These results confirm that Miele\\u2019s sustaina- bility performance is > perceived positively. POLITICAL INTERESTS [GRI 102-13] As a domestic appliance man- ufacturer, Miele is influenced by political decisions and legal requirements. The cor- responding guidelines and measures on issues such as the energy label, ecolog- ical design, hazardous substances and the circular economy have been drawn up pri- marily at a European level in recent years. Member states also draw up their own sus- tainability-related regulations that have an influence on Miele. Miele contributes its exper- tise to the debate surrounding the objectives and implementation of the guidelines through various > national and international commit- tees, commissions and associations. Topics such as national restrictions on substances and programmes for improving resource and material efficiency have also been dis- cussed in the process. In the reporting period, the discussions also centred on the digital- isation of products and services, as well as related questions regarding consumer pro- tection and the company\\u2019s responsibility. [GRI 102-13/-14] Miele maintains a contin- uous dialogue with political representatives who work at regional, national or European level. In its dealings with these representatives, the company argues that effective regulation for the environment, society and customers should be beneficial and should be realisable with as little additional bureaucratic effort as possible. To avoid distortions of competition, proposed legislation should also always be accompanied by a sound impact assessment that takes all potential market and environ- mental effects of the regulation into account and ensures transparency in terms of its imple- mentation. Since the end of 2015, Miele has been registered in the public transparency reg- ister for interest groups in Brussels to provide an insight into which representatives of the EU Commission, EU Parliament and the Euro- pean Council are in direct contact with Miele. WORK WITH ASSOCIATIONS In addition to advocating for certain political interests, company representatives are also involved in the work of national and international associations. One of the executive directors, Dr Markus Miele or Dr Reinhard Zinkann, is rep- resented on each of the boards of the German Central Association of the Electrical and Elec- tronics Industry ZVEI, the German Brands Association, the Stifterverband f\\u00fcr die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Donors\\u2019 association for the pro- motion of humanities and sciences) and \\u2013 at a regional level \\u2013 the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the trade association. Many members of staff are active on association and standardisation committees. Their tasks involve supporting the development of regulations and standards with their expertise while repre- senting Miele\\u2019s interests to the outside world. Miele actively works with associations through representatives of its sales subsidiaries in other EU member states and outside Europe as well. The company representatives then share the information they have gained on topics such as proposed legislation with the company itself. BENEFITING FROM PRACTICAL DIALOGUE [GRI 102-44] Miele also actively engages in dia- logue with environmentalists. For example, the company has been in regular contact with Envi- ronmental Action Germany (DUH) for several years now. As a result, the company engaged in dialogue regarding refrigerator disposal. Miele vehemently denies one organisation\\u2019s accusa- tions of improper conduct in this area and has presented a large number of audits and reviews of the disposal facilities to back up its rebuttal. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS For years, Miele has supported > FORUM WASCHEN as part of various different pro- jects in order to sensitise consumers and other members of society to more sustain- able washing, dishwashing and cleaning in the household. FORUM WASCHEN offers experts from government authorities, fed- eral ministries, research institutes, unions and manufacturers of detergents and house- hold appliances, as well as technical colleges, environmental organisations, universities and consumer associations, a platform where they can share their knowledge. It also contributes to the public debate surrounding sustainability through conferences, special events and exhi- bitions. In addition to practical input through presentations and lectures by experts, Miele supports the platform financially, for example by organising an annual multipliers\\u2019 meeting. 23  Miele

SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Focus on preventing infection The Covid-19 pandemic was associated with a variety of challenges for Miele as well in the reporting period. Miele responded quickly in early 2020 and launched a com- prehensive set of measures, including a significant expansion of remote working opportunities, the introduction of exclu- sive hygiene concepts, transparent communication for all employees and spe- cific guidance for managers. > Protecting employees and third parties from infec- tion was the top priority at all times during the development of appropriate strategies. COORDINATED APPROACH In February 2020, Miele set up a corona- virus coordination team consisting of senior staff from HR, purchasing, logistics, IT, facility management, communication and the com- pany medical service. This central committee also includes employees who coordinate the approach at the sales subsidiaries and the plants. The team defines necessary measures and recommends them to the Miele locations. The people in charge locally are respon- sible for their implementation in accordance with the statutory requirements. In Germany, those requirements include the protective measures adopted by federal and state gov- ernments. At the same time, the coronavirus coordination team monitors and discusses the latest infection figures. Local crisis teams, which are overseen by the appro- priate management staff at the locations, have been set up to round out the efforts. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY The family-owned company quickly devel- oped and implemented its > own hygiene concepts. In some cases, these concepts were ahead of the official measures or went beyond them. The technical conditions for mobile working were enhanced signif- icantly in a short space of time in order to enable a large portion of the workforce to work from home. In addition, buildings were modified by adding automated opening mechanisms to doors and setting up sepa- rating walls and hand sanitizer dispensers, to name just a few examples. Miele advo- cated for wearing face masks before it became commonplace to do so and for replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual conferences, events and business travel. Moreover, occupational health and safety officers partnered with the company med- ical service to provide advice on events. The company also introduced an occupancy con- cept for offices and meeting rooms to ensure 40 AirControl air purifiers were set up at the G\\u00fctersloh location. FACTS & FIGURES FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS CONTENTS the necessary physical distancing. In produc- tion, employees were newly divided into shift groups, and break times were staggered. To ensure sufficient fresh air in enclosed spaces, Miele developed concepts for ventilation sys- tems. A total of 40 mobile Miele > AirControl air purifiers were also set up at the G\\u00fctersloh location alone in meeting, training and break rooms, as well as at the site\\u2019s company child day-care centre. The G\\u00fctersloh facility man- agement team provided those responsible for facility management at Miele\\u2019s German loca- tions with a central source of knowledge and advice about the concept and other meas- ures. The cafeterias at the locations were subject to strict hygiene requirements in line with the latest official protective measures. The company also offered more flexible working hours in order to ease the burden on parents, who faced particularly daunting challenges during the pandemic due to the closures of day-care centres and schools. Parents also had the option of taking addi- tional time off to take care of their children. The family-owned company started offering testing options at the plant in G\\u00fctersloh and at other Miele production sites at an early stage in order to supplement the public health sys- tem\\u2019s efforts to identify cases of Covid-19. 262626  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Despite increased precautionary and pro- tective measures, multiple cases of Covid-19 occurred among employees at the Miele plant in Euskirchen at the end of February 2021. As a consequence, the employees affected and the people they had been in contact with entered into quarantine. Regular manufacturing operations at the location were suspended until the isolation period had ended. COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORT pandemic, the company faced increased > challenges in this respect during the reporting period. At times, it was not pos- sible to obtain the usual volume of parts from suppliers, and the closure of retail stores cut off the personal connection to customers. In addition, production was interrupted at all plants due to the pandemic-related shortening of working hours in early 2020 \\u2013 and again a year later due to Covid-19 infections at the Euskirchen plant. Never- theless, Miele succeeded in keeping supply risks to a minimum by responding early. Keeping employees up to date at all times and offering them support options has been of the essence throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, Miele informed employees and managers of the latest developments and necessary measures at the locations by e-mail on a regular basis during the reporting period. Employees without personal intranet and company e-mail access had the option to receive important information through a mes- senger service on their smartphones. Miele also set up a Corona Information Center on the intranet with comprehensive infor- mation and an FAQ section. All members of the workforce are invited to contact the corona virus coordination team directly if they have any additional questions. Recom- mended courses of action were provided specifically for management staff on topics such as how to handle suspected cases. Miele offered early testing for employees at some locations to determine the number of Covid-19 infections. ENSURING SUPPLY SECURITY Miele\\u2019s goal is to supply customers with premium appliances for household and com- mercial use at all times.

One focal point of the sustainability strategy is to continue to improve the environmental impact of prod- ucts and packaging, making them more sustainable. The agenda includes topics such as repaira- bility and the development of new, sustainable business models.

Featuring timelessly elegant > design they are also crafted to be intuitive and as accessible as possible for all users. The company bases its product development activ- ities on sustainability criteria of its own that exceed the legal specifications. There are var- ious areas of focus here, including durability, > recyclability, repairability and the energy and resource efficiency of appliances in real-world use. The aim is to always offer the all-round best appliance on the market. The company works on this in close > dialogue with con- sumers, suppliers and further partners from the industrial and research sectors and from associations. Miele also focuses on coopera- tion when developing innovative new business models relating to sustainability, for example by working with partners such as start-ups. NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS [GRI 203-2] Miele advances numerous pro- jects with promising start-ups in fields such as the smart home, customer support, digital marketing and industry 4.0. Forms of coopera- tion range from joint development projects and management support to direct capital invest- ment. All of Miele\\u2019s involvement in emerging companies to support the traditional line of business takes place under the Miele Ven- ture Capital umbrella. As one example, Miele holds a stake in Plant Jammer, a Danish com- pany. The Plant Jammer app helps consumers use leftover foods creatively. Another example is KptnCook, a Berlin-based start-up that also offers an app having to do with food \\u2013 from indi- vidual recipe inspiration and shopping right up to the finished dish. MChef, based in the German city of Bielefeld, lets customers place online orders for gourmet dishes already plated on high-quality reusable crockery and prepare them conveniently in the Miele Dialog oven, with options for other oven models starting in 2021. Miele Operations & Payment Solutions, a wholly owned Miele subsidiary founded in 2019, developed the appWash concept for shared use of Miele washing machines and tumble dryers, including online reservations and cashless payment. The idea of using appWash to make it easier and more flexible to use and manage appliances provided centrally \\u2013 in larger apart- ment complexes or student housing, for example \\u2013 arose in the smart home area of expertise. The Miele Professional division also relies on partnerships. During the reporting period, a strategic alliance with the medical technology SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling 5.5% of total turnover is invested in research and development. company W&H was launched. Miele and W&H plan to align their product portfolios in the future, each of them incorporating machines from the other partner into its own range. For Miele, that means adding four new tabletop sterilisers from W&H to its product selection. In turn, the washer-disinfectors that W&H now offers come from the Miele plant in Bielefeld. RENTING INSTEAD OF BUYING [GRI 203-2] Under the \\u201cpay-per-use\\u201d model, customers only pay for individual units of output rather than buying an appliance. In the FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS case of a washing machine, for example, one wash cycle would constitute one unit of output. Studies suggest that a pay-per-use approach could promote sustainable con- sumption, not only raising users\\u2019 awareness of efficient use of energy and other resources, but also delivering possible financial savings. After all, someone who pays for each wash cycle is more likely to wait until they have enough laundry to make up a full load instead of running the machine half-empty. In the Netherlands, Miele has been offering a leasing service for washing machines since 2016. The service involves billing users on the basis of their actual use. The low-cost leasing model allows even price-conscious house- holds such as groups of flatmates to conserve resources by using high-quality, efficient appliances. Miele works with Bundles, another start-up, to offer the pro- gramme. When users terminate the leasing contract, the appliance is returned to Bundles and prepared for the next user. EFFICIENT SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Miele offers its customers more than simply high-performance domestic and commercial appliances \\u2013 it increasingly also offers them complete system solutions. These include the appliance itself, useful accessories, the right 2929  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality cleaning agents, smart control and dosing functions and tailor-made service options. Among other things, Miele washing machines and dishwashers are capable of using sensor data to dispense exactly the right amount of detergent. The TwinDos washing machine dosing function unlocks outstanding cleaning results when used with UltraPhase 1 and 2 detergents while also actively helping to pro- tect the environment. As a result, the machine uses only as much detergent as needed, > conserving resources. TwinDos, like the AutoDos function in dishwashers, also allows for smart inventory management, including convenient ordering of replacement supplies of cleaning products via the Miele app (for- merly the Miele@mobile app). For commercial machines, Miele offers cleaning agents under the ProCare brand, also in combina- tion with resource-efficient automatic dosing. Hygiene products are another business segment where Miele offers system solutions. The Professional Business Unit offers facilities such as hotels, nursing homes and medical practices a wide range of system solutions for cleaning and disinfecting crockery, cutlery and instruments. Miele washer-disinfectors and sterilisers process instruments efficiently and safely while also minimising wear and ensuring that they retain their value. If a machine needs service, Miele medical product technicians travel to the site within 24 hours to quickly find a solution. Beyond that, Miele advises business customers on the cost-effective use of efficient washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers in shared facilities such as utility rooms or employee kitchenettes. Miele also offers convenient system solutions in the coffee preparation segment. Depending on the model, coffee machines from Miele feature automatic cleaning and descaling functions for which Miele offers special cartridges. This ensures efficient cleaning, which in turn contributes to the durability of the product. There are also a number of Miele coffee blends available. The coffee is certified fair trade and organic. CONNECTING DOMESTIC APPLIANCES Miele is a leading provider when it comes to connecting domestic appliances. Under the \\u201cMiele@home\\u201d category, the company carries more than 700 different domestic appliance versions with connectivity capa- bility worldwide as part of its portfolio. These appliances revolutionise operation and offer customers added benefits through increased flexibility, convenience, quality of life and > security. Miele created the Smart Home area of expertise in 2017 to serve as a home for all its expertise in this field and drive fur- ther advances in connectivity. The company also founded a subsidiary called Miele Venture Capital, which invests in innovative start-ups. Connected systems already make running a household energy-efficient, secure and convenient. For example, domestic appli- ances can also be controlled conveniently using Amazon\\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assis- tant. Miele customers can use this function to get information about their appliances\\u2019 operating status, control them using voice commands or get explanations of features.

The Plantcube from the Miele subsidiary Agri- lution brings this revolutionary concept home. The fully automated cabinet-style greenhouse is no larger than a standard refrigerator and offers perfect conditions for growing salad, herbs and microgreens \\u2013 seedlings har- vested after just a few days of growth so that they are especially flavourful and rich in nutrients. Growing food this way takes minimal effort, and the harvest is free of pesticides and other environmental influences.

MEASURES TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT in each phase of the product life cycle Connectivity is increasingly unlocking new application scenarios that bring fur- ther advantages in terms of sustainability. Washing assistants integrated into the Miele app provide information on particularly energy-efficient appliance cycles, for example. The AddLoad feature makes it possible to add laundry items that were inadver- tently left out to a load in progress without having to restart the cycle. AddLoad is dis- played on the machine itself and in the Miele app. This lets users see whether it is pos- sible to add laundry to the washing machine, and if so until when, even from a distance. Product development Achievement of the best energy efficiency classes Production Environmental and energy management Use of the optimal technology1) Avoidance of critical substances Consideration of stakeholder requirements In a smart home, appliances from different manufacturers and product categories have to be able to communicate and interact with each other. To accommodate this need, Miele offers an open interface that can be used to integrate Miele@home devices into cross-manufacturer systems and plat- forms. This enables the use of base functions such as start/stop and checking machine status. To drive further advances in com- patibility and interoperability beyond that, Miele is involved in the > EEBus Initiative and > CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization. The goal of these alliances is to establish common standards in electrotechnical areas and for intelligent energy management. The company also tests the interoperability of connected domestic appliances and other building technology components in projects that receive national and international funding. Material selection targets the use of secondary raw materials and high recyclability and therefore high resource efficiency.

In 2018, the com- pany also launched a way for them to use the app to control multiple machines simultane- ously and order replacement detergents. The app provides information on machine status and sends a signal when detergent is run- ning low. MielePro@mobile is now available in six countries, enabling intelligent connec- tivity for Miele ProfiLine dishwashers as well as washing machines and tumble dryers in the > Little Giants model series. The Miele portfolio currently encompasses over 100 commercial machines with connectivity capa- bility that can be linked using the mobile app. Miele offers a remote maintenance function for connected machines to handle software updates that may be necessary. Available updates can be downloaded and installed on the machine in question remotely if the cus- tomer wishes. Starting in 2021, Miele offers users of its premium ovens the ability to pur- chase additional applications and configure them individually, initially limited to Den- mark as a pilot market. These include the Smart Food ID and Smart Browning Control functions, which use cameras to deter- mine food status inside the oven, followed by preparation using automatic programmes. Remote updates make it possible to equip these kinds of Miele appliances with new applications even after years of use. DIGITAL MANAGEMENT FOR COMMERCIAL MACHINES The MielePro@mobile app lets commer- cial customers access their machines from Miele created the Smart Home Professional unit in 2019 to focus on digital innovation management in the commercial solution seg- ment. Smart Home Professional operates the Miele MOVE platform for the company\\u2019s consumers, giving them a source for digital solutions from Miele Professional. Commer- cial users can also visit the platform for a wide range of digital services across different machines to support their day-to-day work. DESIGN Miele\\u2019s design philosophy encompasses ele- gance and aesthetics alongside intuitive, self-explanatory and accessible handling geared towards the needs of all customers. Accordingly, demographic change in indus- trialised nations has already been a key focus for Miele product development for some time. Right from the development of its appliances, the company takes care to ensure that they are easy to use regardless of the user\\u2019s age or physical capabilities. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling This has been a demonstrable success with the KM 7897 FL induction hob, for example. The system automatically recognises the pots and pans placed on the hob, along with changes in position, and adjusts the heat dis- tribution accordingly. The hob received the prestigious iF Design Award and > iF Gold Award 2020 for its easy and intuitive use. The aim of Miele\\u2019s product development activities is to reduce the complexity which people face in everyday life and to ensure that no one is excluded by applying a con- sistent design to all appliances in one product group and using a universal oper- ating logic. The technical term for this is \\u201cuniversal design\\u201d or \\u201cdesign for all\\u201d. Because design is also intended to encourage users to increase their use of the ECO functions to conserve energy and resources, Miele is careful to offer functions that users perceive as helpful and relevant and are happy to use. Specifically, the goal here is to use positive experiences to create a good feeling, solidi- fying sensible user behaviour and achieving the utmost in customer satisfaction. UNIVERSAL DESIGN [GRI 203-2] The rules of universal design ensure that the following performance charac- teristics are incorporated: broad usability, flexibility, simple and intuitive handling, sensory perception of information, fault tolerance, minimum physical effort, convenience and accessibility. Internal guidelines such as the Miele Ergo- nomic Index and the Haptics Guideline form FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS the basis for product design at Miele that has been optimised for ergonomics appeal to the sense of touch. The company aims to make using Miele domestic appliances possible even for the visually impaired. The Miele W1 Guideline, launched in 2017, is the only washing machine on the market that can be retrofitted to allow people with impaired or no vision to operate it. The standard version of this model also offers easy and intuitive use for all users. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST Miele always optimises existing products and develops new ones in keeping with legal requirements and in line with its own stan- dards that go beyond what is required by law. For example, the company also ful- fils the EU-wide Ecodesign Directive, which was revised during the reporting period. This directive on automatic washing machines and washer dryers, for example, sets specific requirements for manufacturers of prod- ucts like washing machines and their washing and rinsing functions. These specifications, which address aspects such as energy effi- ciency, will take effect by stages. Lawmakers have also stipulated repairability requirements to ensure that consumers have the option of obtaining repairs, thereby making it possible to use machines for longer. Producers like Miele are required to provide certain replace- ment parts for seven or ten years, depending on the product and target group, for example. The requirements took effect in March 2021 for the product categories of washing machines, 3232  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality washer-dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators, with further domestic appliances to follow. In order to keep all the key aspects in mind from pre-development to series maturity, Miele works with its in-house IMNU 2.0 product development system. Part of this system is the environmental checklist. It supports development projects with guidelines that show areas of focus that would make sense from an environmental stand- point. The environmental checklist also includes Miele-specific requirements for environmental design, repairability and packaging materials, as well as material specifications relating to things like the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons (PAHs), plasticisers or recycled plastics. These requirements go beyond the legal stipula- tions on the use of chemicals. Another element of the product development system is an inter- national digital rights registry, which provides information on the various legal require- ments that apply to machine development and makes it possible to keep these in mind on a country-specific and product-specific basis. Miele also develops scenarios for individual product categories that make it possible to sys- tematically analyse and regularly review trends and likely developments, including in the context of sustainability. In order to integrate sustain- ability aspects into the product development process right from the start, Miele also pro- duces corresponding life cycle assessments for relevant technological modifications. DIALOGUE FOR SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS [GRI 102-43] Cooperation shortens the path to success, which is why extensive dialogue is especially important to Miele. Various Miele departments and external part- ners work hand in hand during the product development process: The Design Center, marketing and market research teams pinpoint > customer needs, analyse the potential for improving existing appliances and machines and assess the prospects for new products. Designers and developers devote themselves to ideas and concepts. The toolshop, prefabrication and assembly areas cooperate closely with suppliers right from the early phases of development. Employees themselves also frequently supply valuable impetus for lasting improvements. In addition to the corporate suggestion scheme, which was rebranded > \\u201cIdee M\\u201d in 2018, Miele provides employees at many locations with GO IDEA, a database-driven ideas platform. The platform was intro- duced at the G\\u00fctersloh production plant for what is now the Laundry Business Unit in 2015 and later adopted in the Cooking, Small Domestic Appliances and Profes- sional Business Units as well. There are also idea scouts for the various product segments who work on idea develop- ment, manage the decision-making process through a committee and keep employees abreast of new ideas and activities. Supplier expertise is highly sought after, especially when new materials or the chal- lenging field of electromechanics are involved. Regular product innovation workshops held jointly with suppliers help to identify issues that could impact quality early on.

With this in mind, Miele engages in regular dialogue with further interest groups and expert part- ners, such as the Oeko-Institut Freiburg. TOGETHER AGAINST MICROPLASTICS istry of Education and Research, which involved representatives of industry, the research sector and environmental asso- ciations. The project focused in particular on solutions in the areas of textile produc- tion and waste water treatment technology that looked at different stages of the tex- tile production chain and life cycle. Miele has watched closely and responded as public discussion surrounding the harmful global environmental impacts of plastic has surged in recent years. One area of special concern here is microplastics (tiny plastic particles and fibres with a diameter of less than 5 millimetres). This subject is espe- cially relevant to Miele, as microplastics can also enter the environment during washing, when they are released from clothing into the waste water system. From there, microplas- tics can find their way into the food chain and be consumed by humans, posing a health risk. Miele has been researching how to prevent or at least sharply reduce microplastics in suds for some time now. Miele washing machines themselves already make a significant contribution towards this aim. Specially designed honeycomb drums and adapted washing programmes handle clothing gently, minimising fibre abrasion. Pre-treatment of fabrics by the textile man- ufacturer offers great potential for reducing microplastics. Filter technologies in washing machines could also help, but economi- cally efficient use of filters is not possible with current technologies. To come up with further solutions, Miele partici- pated in the TextileMission joint research project funded by the German Federal Min- CUSTOMER NEEDS AND FUTURE SCENARIOS [GRI 102-43/-44] Miele market research has been conducting customer and satisfaction surveys in Germany and many other countries for over 30 years. As a result, it receives more than 250,000 consumer opinions every year from across the globe. Miele mines these for informative findings on market perception, pur- chasing decisions and user behaviour. Miele also works in cooperation with national and international market research institutes such as GfK to ensure that its product development activities are conducted on a firm footing. Direct contact with consumers is an integral part of the work done by Miele designers. At the G\\u00fctersloh site, for example, Miele has its own test studio which is used to perform us - ability tests. Here, a representative selection of consumers is given the opportunity to exten- sively test new domestic appliances. Working with consumer associations is another impor- tant factor. For example, Miele development teams work closely with the German Fed- eration of the Blind and Partially Sighted to design accessible products. They also develop future scenarios based on trend analyses, user models and the latest user experience (UX) methods, as well as observations and SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling surveys. These scenarios help the company identify the needs of tomorrow early on and address them in its development activities. Together with other companies that do research, Miele crafts visions of a digitalised and more sustainable life. Toward this aim, Miele Smart Home teamed up with Z_Punkt and the architecture firm Graft in early 2020 to launch the > FuturePIX initiative. In cooperation with further companies, two workshops have been held to develop an initial shared image of urban space in Europe for the year 2030. The initiative aims to combine the expertise of the various participating companies to assess the changes that are on the horizon for people\\u2019s living environments and use this as a source of insight for corporate strategies, new business segments and lines of business for participating stakeholders. During the reporting period, Miele also worked on innovative solutions for its own processes. These activities focused on the digital transformation of customer service, with customers\\u2019 possible future expectations as one area of analysis. Over 30 years of Miele market research FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 3434  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality Long service life, low consumption From day one, the core of the Miele product philosophy has been to offer its customers products of exceptional quality and with a particularly long service life. As a com- pany focused on sustainability, Miele also pays great attention to energy effi- ciency. More than three-quarters of the energy that domestic and commercial appliances need from development to dis- posal is consumed during the > usage phase. Miele adopts a holistic approach here too. In addition to energy demand, water consumption and the use of chemi- cals such as detergents also play a major role in relation to potential conservation. All Miele appliances are designed with maximum efficiency in mind under real conditions. For example, they feature a range of > consumption-reducing functions. Addi- tional potential for conserving resources is opened up by connectivity and incorporation into smart home concepts. In this process, Miele makes sure that low consumption does not come at the expense of practical benefit \\u2013 for example with respect to programme duration, > noise levels and the results achieved when cooking, cleaning, washing and vacuuming. ENERGY LABEL REFORM During the reporting period, the compa- ny\\u2019s areas of focus included the > reform of the energy label and providing associ- ated > information to customers. The new EU product label is intended to help con- sumers purchase energy-efficient large domestic appliances. A revised scale from A to G \\u2013 which initially applies to washing machines, washer-dryers, dishwashers, refrig- erators and freezers and wine storage units \\u2013 has been in effect since 1 March 2021. The previous A+++, A++ and A+ classes have been eliminated. Beyond that, more-realistic methods of measuring energy consump- tion and determining the label class were introduced in some areas. The new legis- lation was specifically drafted to ensure that few products, if any, are assigned to the highest label classes for some time to come. Because new calculation methods were applied, the old scale and the new one are not comparable. For example, refrigerators and freezers that previously fell within the old labelling scheme\\u2019s most efficient classes, from A+++ to A, may now be rated C to F, even with no change in energy consumption.

WASHING MACHINES [GRI 302-5] In the business year 2020, all Miele washing machines sold in the EU fell within what was then the best energy label class, A+++. Beyond that, the proportion of washing machines that consume at least 10 percent less energy than is required to be included in the best energy efficiency class (depending on the model) has increased significantly in recent years. The figure stood at 82 percent in the business year 2020 (2019: 72 percent). Under the energy label requirements that took effect in March 2021, almost all front loader models are rated for the new best energy effi- ciency class, A, thanks to their innovative, highly efficient technology. The only model to come in second best, with a B rating, is the entry-level model with a load capacity of 7 kilogrammes. Top loaders fall in energy efficiency class C. Miele systematically develops its domestic and commercial appliances further by giving consider- ation to the entire product life cycle. As the scope for achieving further improvements in efficiency is getting smaller and smaller, the need for smart solutions is high. For this reason, Miele introduced the SingleWash programme in 2018. This pro- gramme improves the environmental performance of the washing machines when a very light load is used. Unfortunately, light loads are becoming more and more common in daily life, previously resulting in high energy demands. By using this programme, the washing machine uses 60 percent less energy and 51 percent less water compared with conventional automatic load detection. In addition, the cycle is also reduced by 59 percent. Some Miele household models even offer an addi- tional connection for hot water, rain or well water. Using solar-heated hot water, for example, makes it possible to reduce electricity consumption by a further 35 percent compared to the use of cold tap water. The new Little Giants commercial model series introduced in early 2019 includes washing machines and tumble dryers that use as much as 22 percent less water and 28 percent less elec- tricity compared with the previous generation. 100% of Miele washing machines sold in 2020 reach the highest efficiency class available on the market. Washing machine operation is continuously being adjusted to reflect customers\\u2019 current needs and requirements. The large M Touch user interface is as intuitive, easy and quick to use as a smart- phone. The white script on black background that is typical of Miele appliances is also highly legible. The size of the touch display also contributes to ease of handling.

Since washer dryers are frequently used for washing alone, the new label has two parts. testing by Stiftung Warentest (tested 09/2020). It was the only model to earn the highest rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d, putting it well ahead of the sec- ond-ranked contender. The Miele appliance stood out from the rest in the testing criteria of drying, handling and environmental properties in particular. The new Little Giants commer- cial tumble dryer generation also includes a model featuring heat pump technology. All Miele washer dryers have the highest energy efficiency rating, A, for their wash cycles. That is true of both the old energy label and the new one. The washing and drying programme achieves energy efficiency class D under the new labelling scheme. TUMBLE DRYERS [GRI 302-5] In the case of tumble dryers, the percentage of appliances with the previous best energy efficiency rating, A+++, rose signif- icantly in the reporting period, from 52 percent in 2019 to 59 percent in 2020. The fact that the particularly efficient heat pump technology has been introduced onto the market played a crucial role in this. Thanks to further techno- logical developments, the new top model \\u201cT1 Passion\\u201d surpassed the limit value of A+++ by 10 percent. The EcoDry technology with particularly effective filter system and mainte- nance-free heat exchanger ensures low energy consumption and short drying times on a long- term basis. The shift to R290 refrigerant also marks a big step forward in moving toward a tumble dryer range without chlorofluorocar- bons. Seventy-six percent of the tumble dryers with heat pump sold in Europe in 2020 were already equipped with this climate-friendlier refrigerant. In 2020, the Miele heat pump tumble dryer TEB 155 WP emerged the only winner in DISHWASHERS [GRI 302-5] Miele introduced the G 7000 series back in 2018. Its AutoDos system with inte- grated PowerDisk dispenses the detergent according to the programme selected or \\u2013 in automatic mode \\u2013 according to the level of dirt. This makes cleaning particularly efficient as overdosing of detergent is prevented. Fur- ther refinements were also made in mobile > control via app for greater convenience and ease. In some countries, Amazon\\u2019s voice assis- tant > Alexa is also available for this purpose. This means that customers can, for example, start and stop their dishwasher from anywhere, check fill levels or order detergent online. In all, the percentage of dishwashers with the previous best energy efficiency rating rose during the reporting period, climbing from 44 percent in 2019 to 51 percent in 2020. Miele launched the new generation of under-countertop tank dishwashers in the PTD 70x model series during the reporting period for superior efficiency in profes- sional dishwashing applications. The narrow glass cleaning model in particular is much more resource-efficient, with standard pro- SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling grammes using just 2 litres of water to rinse and the Eco programme lowering the figure still further, to 1.8 litres. This represents a saving of 17 and 25 percent, respectively, over the previous generation. The other three models in this series use 8 to 17 percent less water. This is achieved through opti- mised water routing and redesigned spray arms. Because the system uses less water, it also needs less energy and detergent. VACUUM CLEANERS [GRI 302-5] Since 2017, the Ecodesign Reg- ulation for Vacuum Cleaners has restricted the power of vacuum cleaners to a max- imum of 900 watts and placed higher demands on dust suction and noise reduc- tion. At the heart of the Miele vacuum cleaner is a highly efficient fan with up to 25 percent better effectiveness than its pre- decessor. Together with various > appliance optimisations and appropriate accesso- ries, such as the fine dust Miele HyClean 3D Efficiency dustbag, this fan ensures the cleaning performance is constantly high with significantly lower energy consumption. Efficient floorheads also play an impor- tant role here, as they can achieve top-class cleaning results even with low wattage and low power settings. Vacuum cleaners with EcoTeQ floorheads made up 17 percent of those sold in the EU in 2020. The high per- formance capacity of these machines with 550 watts has also been confirmed by testing institutes. In early 2021, Stiftung Warentest named a model from the EcoLine series (550 watts) the winner in its test, with the top mark of 2.0 (tested 02/2021).

All programmes and functions undergo continuous improvement to reduce consumption and achieve superior efficiency in real-world use. 3939  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality and research confirm that this is also worth- while from an ecological perspective (> UBA 2016, > \\u00d6ko-Institut 2015, > \\u00d6ko-Institut 2018). 5,600 programme cycles is what a Miele dishwasher must deliver during testing. DURABILITY: ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL PRODUCT SERVICE LIFE MIELE APPLIANCES REMAIN A PART OF THE HOME FOR LONGER In order to benefit from the ecological advan- tages of durability, however, the appliances must be used by consumers for long enough. In fact, Miele domestic appliances are used in the home for longer than appliances from other manufacturers before they are either sold on or replaced due to a defect. This has been repeat- edly confirmed in several studies in the past. In a survey, Stiftung Warentest discovered that users of Miele tumble dryers mentioned rel- atively few issues and faults compared with competitor products, even with appliances as old as 20 years or more (tested 09/2018). Miele is the only manufacturer in the industry that tests its products to last up to 20 years. The requirements that appliances must sat- isfy in these tests are defined in a separate plant standard. For washing machines and washer dryers for household use, Miele assumes five programme cycles a week, or 5,000 over 20 years. Commercial machines also undergo service life testing. For example, Miele calculates two programme cycles per day for cleaning and disinfection devices in the PG 85 series, which works out to more than 15,000 hours of operation over 20 years. This exceptional durability of Miele prod- ucts is the result of sturdy construction, the use of high-quality materials and demanding load and endurance tests. Various surveys Customer satisfaction is a factor that is not to be underestimated when it comes to ensuring that domestic appliances are used for as long as possible. If a domestic appliance does its job reliably and delivers the results, user con- venience, energy efficiency and design that customers ask for, a functioning appliance will very rarely be replaced early. As a result, key tasks for product development activities at Miele include > timeless design, good repairability and the ability to update control software to the latest version later on. The current brand loyalty con- firms the success of this strategy. According to Stiftung Warentest, more than 70 percent of people who use a Miele washing machine or tumble dryer would opt for a Miele appliance again. More than 77 percent would \\u201cdefinitely\\u201d recommend Miele tumble dryers (test 04/2018). SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling NEW SOFTWARE FOR OLDER APPLIANCES The increasing importance of software in domestic appliances offers the oppor- tunity to improve functions over the long utilisation phase of Miele appliances or to adapt them to new requirements. Thanks to standardised diagnostic support from authorised Miele service partners, soft- ware improvements can be installed not just on new appliances, but also on those that have already been produced. The company also introduced a remote main- tenance function in 2020, which has already made it possible to optimise or expand the software in domestic appliances in many countries around the world from a distance. GOOD REPAIRABILITY Miele domestic appliances are renowned for their reliability. Nevertheless, over the course of a long appliance life, faults may occur that require the assistance of the service team. In order to keep customer costs low in such cases, the appliances are designed to be \\u201crepair-friendly\\u201d. This means that as little effort as possible should be required to repair or replace a component. As Miele assumes a service life of up to 20 years for its products, its supply of spare parts is organised gener- ously. Around 70,000 different original Miele spare parts are therefore permanently held in stock at the central warehouse in G\\u00fcter- sloh. From there, they are then dispatched as required to locations all over the world and are available for many years after produc- tion of the particular appliance has ceased. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS GENTLE TREATMENT OF TEXTILES AND CROCKERY Durability in the broader sense of the word also includes the gentle treatment of textiles and the care of valuable cutlery and crockery in the dishwasher. In the case of washing machines, shorter programme durations, for example, protect the laundry and extend the life of the garments. Special detergents can also extend the life span of products. With this in mind, Miele introduced process chem- icals that are especially gentle on materials in its ProCare series during the reporting period. These phosphate-free, microplastic-free prod- ucts for commercial dishwashers and washing machines carry the EU Ecolabel. This seal of quality is used for products and services that are more ecofriendly than standard products. PRODUCT SAFETY: EXTENSIVE TESTING [GRI 416-1] As a general rule, all Miele prod- ucts are extensively tested with respect to health and safety risks to the consumer. Compliance with product safety aspects is tested and certified by independent bodies such as VDE, DEKRA or T\\u00dcV, and the prod- ucts are certified accordingly. In addition to laws and standards, in-house Miele stand- ards apply in certain areas, and in some cases have significantly more stringent requirements with respect to product safety. Extensive tests and service life inspec- tions also contribute to product safety as do findings from customer service callouts. In an industry comparison, Miele achieves a very high level of vertical integration of up to 50 percent depending on the product. This 4040  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality helps the company to differentiate the core components from the competition, strongly influencing the quality of these components, and therefore also enhancing product safety. Ensuring product safety is also a process that involves several areas, as Corporate Regu- latory Affairs (SRA), the design/development departments and Quality Management all work in close cooperation with each other. Certain sources of faults are carefully identified and assessed using targeted, global market mon- itoring, customer service feedback, product recalls, or spare parts sales (field monitoring). Influences from modified user behaviour can also be identified in this way. An additional factor is preventive quality work, which accompanies new products as early as the product develop- ment phase with the aid of test series and can therefore have an influence at an early stage. 70,000 spare parts are kept in stock up to 15 years after production of the particular appliance series. the countries where the products are distrib- uted. For example, this includes the full and reproducible documentation of each individual batch of sterile products as a matter of course. MEETING HIGH HYGIENE STANDARDS Miele\\u2019s professional commercial laundry appli- ances offer special programmes to suit the particular hygiene requirements of establish- ments such as retirement homes, hospitals or hotels. The same is true of fresh water com- mercial dishwashers, which meet significantly higher hygiene standards than models with a tank system, as fresh water is used for each rinse cycle. They also offer special programmes with high final rinse temperatures (up to more than 93\\u00b0C) and long temperature holding times. This combination of high temperatures and long holding times produces particularly hygienic cleaning results. The hygiene requirements in the medical technology sector are even higher. As a certified medical product manufacturer, Miele meets all statutory hygiene standards of A new series of CUBE-X sterilisers available since autumn 2019 offers processes that meet par- ticularly stringent hygiene standards for various loads, such as hollow medical instruments used in settings such as dentists\\u2019 offices. These prod- ucts do not require maintenance until five years or 4,000 cycles into their service life \\u2013 much later than comparable devices from competitors. In addition, Miele launched the Miele AirCon- trol air purifier series on the market in January 2021. These machines filter all of the air in a room up to 200 square meters in size six times an hour, using five levels of filtration to trap floating particles, viruses, bacteria and mould. The air purifiers are especially suitable for use in meeting rooms, childcare facili- ties, classrooms and retail outlets. When used in tandem with other hygiene measures, they can help to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling STRICT STANDARDS FOR POLLUTANT-FREE PRODUCTS [GRI 102-11] As a matter of principle, Miele avoids the use of critical substances, wher- ever possible. Before any substances are used, Miele establishes whether they are considered critical by experts, and whether there are reasons to avoid them relating to the environment and/or human health. To this end, the use of critical substances is restricted by specifications that apply throughout the company, such as Miele\\u2019s own company standards. Compliance with rel- evant legal standards is second nature to Miele. Such standards include, for example, the EU chemicals regulation (REACH) and the EU directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances (RoHS). Compliance is monitored through analysis of products and components. EMISSIONS AND INDOOR CLIMATE Miele appliances are optimised in every conceiv- able way so that emissions like noise, odours and moisture are also kept to a minimum. For example, Miele dishwashers and cooker hoods are among the quietest products on the market. Even in open-plan kitchens, the operating noises are not regarded as a nuisance. Another advantage of this is that dishwashers, for example, can be operated outside of electricity peaks and at off-peak tariffs, where applicable. Miele tumble dryers operate highly efficiently and produce the lowest condensate losses compared with competitor products. As a result, they release a particularly low amount FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS of moisture into the ambient air. This is advan- tageous both in terms of energy efficiency and for health reasons, as excessive air humidity can lead to mould formation in rooms without sufficient ventilation. During the cold winter months, however, ventilating indoor spaces results in significant heat loss, which can only be addressed by turning up the heat and thus using more energy. Miele cooker hoods and ovens are equipped with filters or catalysers (depending on the model for ovens) to min- imise odours while also preventing greasy vapours from entering the ambient air. Miele\\u2019s goal is to curb emissions in floor care as well, which is why Miele vacuum cleaners have multi-stage filtration systems. Depending on the model, examples include HEPA filters, which trap microscopic particles and allergens. Thanks to their sustainable properties, Miele machines were selected for a very special pro- ject in Denmark. Miele is a standard equipment provider involved in designing Denmark\\u2019s very first \\u201cgreen city\\u201d. Between now and 2024, sus- tainable housing and work space is being created in Copenhagen\\u2019s Carlsberg district. The G\\u00fctersloh-based manufacturer is sup- plying some 15,000 domestic appliances for the project, in which sustainability takes centre stage across every area of domestic life, from timeless design and carbon neutrality to the long life spans of Miele appliances. 4141  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Customer orientation and information Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Customer orientation and information Ensuring maximum customer satisfaction For Miele, meeting the expectations of its customers when it comes to products and services \\u2013 and even exceeding them where possible \\u2013 is of the utmost importance. Long-term partnerships with retailers are one important factor in this. Miele appliances are sold in Germany, Europe and abroad through authorised dealers and by Miele itself. The company uses this approach to ensure high quality when it comes to marketing as well. In 2020, Miele supplied over 12,500 author- ised dealers in Germany. These dealers adopt the same high demands for quality in terms of presentation, range of products and services, consultation skills and cus- tomer services. Miele and its partners apply the same standards in e-commerce as well. As sustainability is becoming increasingly important to consumers, Miele provides transparent information on the sustain- able design and use of its products. GROWING INTEREST IN SUSTAINABILITY [GRI 417-1/-2] In many countries, Miele is registering a growing interest in sus- tainability among customers, especially with respect to consumption. Efficiency values for electricity, water and gas have become a key argument when it comes to making decisions to purchase, as feed- back from dealers and customer surveys show. Miele uses various channels of communication to inform its customers about sustainability, including informa- tion provided on the product (EU energy consumption labelling), operating instruc- tions, product brochures and consultations with dealers and in showrooms around the world, as well as international trade fairs. Corporate communications and the com- pany website also contain information on sustainability aspects. Information on the proper > disposal and > safe operation of machines is prominently featured in various locations. Incorrect or inadequate infor- mation on this subject could have negative consequences for people and the environ- ment. Miele uses the Sustainability Report, for example, to report on matters such as where the components of its products come from and whether recycled materials are used. Communication about sustainability reaches customers, together with informa- tion about the good reputation of the Miele brand. In representative studies conducted by the Miele market research team from 2019 to the first quarter of 2021, the majority of the approximately 54,000 respon dents in 15 European countries confirmed that Miele supports a sustainable lifestyle. Over 12,500 authorised dealers for Miele domestic appliances and commercial machines FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS There were no relevant incidents of non-compliance with regulations or rules of conduct relating to product and service information and labelling during the reporting period. EXTENDED WARRANTIES AVAILABLE From material defects to manufacturing errors, Miele\\u2019s two-year manufacturer warranty means > repairs are free of charge for customers. For added peace of mind, customers can extend the war- ranty to five or ten years as long as it has not yet expired. Miele teamed up with an insurance partner in 2018 to offer an extended warranty service, pro- viding full coverage for appliances that are already out of warranty, where the extended warranty is expiring soon or that are already ten years old or more. The \\u201cMiele Service Zertifikat Plus\\u201d package comes with a monthly fee. This is one way Miele is doing its part to extend the period of application of its appliances and thereby conserve resources. The service has been very well received by customers, with over 25,000 contracts concluded in 2020 \\u2013 about 1,000 more than the previous year. 4242  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality AFTER-SALES CUSTOMER SERVICE Miele employs approximately 2,500 ser- vice technicians who regularly undergo rigorous training and complete their ser- vice calls with the help of extensively equipped service vans. The \\u201cfirst-call completion rate\\u201d (percentage of service requests complete after the first service call) for Miele Service is 80 to 85 per- cent globally. In Germany, a rate of over 90 percent has already been achieved. DETAILED CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR RECALL CAMPAIGNS [GRI 416-2] Despite Miele\\u2019s high quality standards, recall campaigns may become necessary in certain very rare instances. Detailed contingency plans are in place for this, with the names of the persons respon- sible for taking prompt action. Experiences from such recalls are thoroughly analysed and considered for future developments. There were no recall campaigns during the reporting period. VIRTUAL INTERIOR PLANNING It allows customers to see what \\u201ctheir\\u201d kitchen would look like in advance. Solutions like this one are mainly offered and promoted by kitchen design software manufacturers. SENSITIVE HANDLING OF CUSTOMER DATA [GRI 418-1] Miele views protecting the > Miele@home infrastructure and secure handling of customer data as extremely important. Trust in Miele must also be secured, even in an interconnected world. With this in mind, the company takes a whole host of precautions, utilises state- of-the-art encryption methods and works tirelessly in conjunction with external spe- cialists to make further improvements to the security architecture. In addition to the EU General Data Protection Regu- lation (GDPR), the Miele privacy policy, rolled out in 2018, sets out rules on han- dling of digital data, especially customer data. There were no substantiated com- plaints regarding data protection or privacy infringements among customers in the reporting period. There were also no cases of data theft or loss of customer data. The collection, storage, processing and use of all personal customer data are per- formed according to data protection rules. Many people would like to plan and deco- rate their household individually and consider vari ous options as quickly, realistically and easily as possible. As a result, Miele is increasingly focusing on digital presentation and planning for various product configu- rations and providing the necessary data for them to do so. Virtual reality is increas- ingly important in the visualisation of kitchen designs at kitchen and furniture stores.

CARE TIPS FOR LONG APPLIANCE LIFE Miele appliances are known for their superior durability and reliability. But even high-quality products require proper care \\u2013 something that could help to avoid some service cases. In France, Miele launched a campaign on this topic. The campaign included a brochure containing care tips, information at retail locations (via QR codes, for example) and online tutorials on social media. The dura- bility and repairability of domestic appliances are viewed as very important in France. As a result, the campaign generated a very positive response and will be continued. CONTENTS 4343  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality AWARDS FOR QUALITY AND SERVICE Various awards repeatedly confirm the reliability of Miele\\u2019s appliances and customer service. These include the following from the reporting period: At the Domestic Appliance Awards organised by the consultancy firm Kantar, Miele received top marks in the cate- gory of customer satisfaction in 2019 across all the markets studied (Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Spain) and across all product categories. In 2020, participating consumers also chose Miele as the most trustworthy brand. Xing and kununu career networks conducted in the autumn of 2019. In 2020, Miele received the \\u201cKVA Service Award\\u201d from the Austrian Association for Customer Service. This marks the 17th time that the company has been among the win- ners after 19 competitions in all.

FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 4444  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Disposal and recycling Environmentally responsible treatment of old appliances Once a Miele product reaches the end of its typical long useful life, the next step is to send it for recycling or for further disposal via a return system. This is why Miele actively works on continuously improving the return systems. The company\\u2019s special focus here is on the areas of logistics and protecting the environment. Miele also engages with con- sumers in particular through various channels, initiatives and campaigns, sharing informa- tion on how to properly return old appliances for environmentally responsible disposal. FURTHER ENHANCING RECYCLABILITY Making sure an appliance is recyclable down the line is a factor as early as during > product development. For example, Miele works with waste management compa- nies and operators of treatment plants to study the potential effects on disposal or ini- tial treatment and recycling of appliances at the end of a product\\u2019s life. Both domestic and commercial appliances from Miele are characterised by a very high level of recy- clability. This is achieved through various means, including careful selection of mate- rials and bonding techniques. For example, the company is careful to use plastics of the same type frequently in order to make recy- cling easier or even possible in the first place. To facilitate disassembly and separation, the number of different material types and screw varieties is also kept to a minimum. Wherever it may be possible and practical without affecting quality, Miele investigates whether secondary or alternative, more recy- clable materials can be used. One important area is packaging for cleaning and care prod- ucts. Miele has the recyclability of some of its plastic packaging tested and assessed by external institutes. Experts from Miele and waste management companies also jointly conduct practical tests on selected packaging types to ensure that the materials used are easy to separate and then sort for recycling. In December 2019, Miele specialists visited a disposal partner in Porta Westfalica, Germany. While there, they discussed current topics in the field of packaging and took a guided tour of the sorting facility for lightweight pack- aging materials. The group was especially interested in the opportunity to see a spe- cial technology used to separate multilayer packages via near-infrared spectroscopy. CLOSING THE LOOP [GRI 301-2] In May 2018, the European Council adopted a circular economy package that has shaped development SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling and production activities at Miele to a sig- nificant degree since then. It includes changes in multiple waste-specific direc- tives, including for packaging, and has now been incorporated into many laws at the national level. It also makes possible fur- ther steps towards achieving a fully circular economy. Miele supports these plans and has implemented various projects to recycle components from old Miele appliances Miele is also increasingly focusing on circular models to boost the use of recycled and recyclable materials. The product category of vacuum cleaners and accessories offers one example. In 2020, the company began producing one brush, two heads and one dusting brush from post-consumer recycled plastic. This means the plastic was previ- ously used by consumers and then recycled. At the same time, the family-owned com- pany supports different projects aimed at promoting the circular economy. One of them is the WEEE-Harz project, which is receiving funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The pro- ject is studying how a sustainable circular economy for electrical appliances can be developed in Germany\\u2019s Harz region. Miele also began working with other producers FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS and stakeholders in the disposal industry in the Dialogforum effiziente Kreislaufwirtschaft (Efficient Circular Economy Dialogue Forum) in 2020 to help further improve the infor- mation system for efficient recycling. RESPONSIBLE RETURNS AND DISPOSAL [GRI 301-3] Throughout the world, Miele strives to ensure that its materials are recy- cled in an environmentally friendly manner along the entire waste management chain, and support the fight against illegal trade involving waste electrical appliances. In the EU, the return and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment is regu- lated by the WEEE Directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive). The Electrical and Electronic Equipment Act (ElektroG) transposes the provisions of the WEEE Directive into German law. The body in charge of its implementation is the German national register for waste electric equipment (known as stiftung ear). Among other things, it is responsible for registering manufac- turers, coordinating the provision of collection containers by manufacturers and arranging to pick up old appliances at transfer points set up by municipalities.

A particular focus is placed on the environmentally friendly disposal of > refrigeration equipment. In other EU countries, Miele uses similar \\u2013 and in some cases state-run \\u2013 return and recycling systems, such as Recupel in Belgium, Eco-syst\\u00e8mes in France and UFH in Austria. Outside the EU, Miele makes use of the established disposal systems already in place. The \\u201cE-Waste Recycling\\u201d association is responsible for collecting and disposing of old electronics in Russia. It was founded by manufacturers in 2017 and has since devel- oped disposal standards and an audit system to monitor recycling companies. Beyond that, Miele also works on the fur- ther development and harmonization of disposal standards. For example, the com- pany participated in May 2020 in a workshop as part of the European Commission\\u2019s study on > quality standards for the treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Miele was also involved in the development of the EN 50614:2020 standard, published in 2020. This standard sets out uniform requirements for preparing to reuse waste electrical and electronic equipment. The goal is to ensure that it is possible to reuse appliances that are still usable or their com- ponents, even within the waste management regime itself. Across all of Miele\\u2019s activities in this area, the overarching goal is to ensure product safety for consumers while estab- lishing uniform competitive conditions and standards for the stakeholders involved. 4646  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality RETURNS OF OLD APPLIANCES [GRI 301-3] In Germany, the ElektroG (2015, amended in 2021) requires manufacturers, local authorities, brick-and-mortar dealers and online distributors with a sales area or storage/ dispatch area of 400 square metres or more to accept the return of old appliances. Miele offers to accept returns of old appliances of the same type when a new appliance is purchased online as well. Beyond that, small appliances with external dimensions of less than 25 cen- timetres can be returned free of charge, whether or not a new one is purchased. In cooperation with the return service provider WEEE Return, small appliances returned to Miele are handled and recycled properly. > Miele dealers are also important partners. When buying a new appliance, customers can state whether they would like to have the dealer dispose of the old one. When the new product is delivered, the dealer takes the registered old appliance and delivers it either to a municipal collection point or directly to initial handling and recycling. The quantities that have been taken back and disposed of by manufacturers via stiftung ear have continued to rise sharply over the past few years, from just under 80,000 pickups in 2018 to over 90,000 in 2020. The increase is likely due to the effects of the expanded scope of the law (open scope) and other trends, such as the shift towards battery-powered appli- ances and devices. Increased consumer purchasing power and an uptick in pri- vate domestic appliance disposal due to the Covid-19 pandemic may also be fac- tors here. The total return requirement for providers in the appliance categories/col- lection groups is calculated based on the quantities brought into circulation. In the 2020 calendar year, Miele accepted returns of more than 12,350 tonnes of old appli- ances in the relevant categories across Germany on instructions from stiftung ear. RECLAIMED PACKAGING [GRI 301-3] As part of its legal obliga- tions, Miele also ensures that packaging is reclaimed in Germany. In keeping with an industry solution developed by manufac- turers of domestic appliances and of kitchen furnishings and accessories, the company has transport packaging materials picked up and disposed of properly by a shared disposal service provider and its subcontrac- tors. Sales packaging and outer packaging, which typically constitutes waste after the appliances are used by customers, are col- lected in Germany via the \\u201cdual system\\u201d. Miele engages in dialogue on this point with waste management companies and recycling and environmental technology engineering companies to identify potential ways to improve the recyclability of its packaging. Annual package disposal activities give rise to greenhouse gas emissions by waste man- agement companies, which are offset by climate action projects. For the business year 2019, Miele\\u2019s partner offset 512 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in the transportation packaging segment, and the relevant emis- sion reduction certificates were retired. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling Miele is working with experts to make packaging even more recyclable by design. POLLUTANTS DURING DISPOSAL [GRI 305-6/-7, 416-1] The aim of proper dis- posal is to make substances that carry health risks or are harmful to the environ- ment as innocuous as possible. One example of this type of pollutant involves refrigerants and insulants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs are multiple times > more harmful to the environment than CO2. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Older refrigeration equipment, including refrigerators, often still contains CFCs. The law requires manufacturers to recover CFCs to the greatest extent possible at the dis- posal stage. Miele meets these obligations as part of a manufacturing consortium which includes its specialised service providers. The DIN EN 50625-2-3 standard and TS 50625-3-4 specifications are explicitly part of the contracts with waste management 4747  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality companies and also apply to participating subcontractors. The methods and treatment facilities involved, along with their opera- tors, are also subject to stringent permitting requirements and checks by supervisory authorities in Germany. Miele also partici- pates in joint external audits via a consortium of manufacturers and obligates its disposal service providers to undergo audits of their treatment facilities for refrigeration equip- ment by a research institution approved to perform this kind of testing. The double audit system means that each treatment facility undergoes an average of four audits a year. The audit process includes various esca- lation levels in case any deviations from the standards are found. Immediate meas- ures can often remedy any problems. In the case of critical deviations, the last resort is to halt deliveries to the facility in question until a subsequent audit has been performed and the necessary measures have been accepted by the testing body. Recycling facil- ities are also subject to regular leakproofing tests (100-device test under the German Technical Instructions on Air Quality Con- trol (TA Luft)) and 1,000-device performance tests. Facility operators are additionally required to perform checks of their own. and has negative consequences for the environment. Consumers also share in the responsibility for making it difficult to col- lect waste illegally. As a result, Miele helps its customers to dispose responsibly of old appliances and transport packaging by pro- viding information in the appliance operating instructions and on the > miele-website. In 2020, the company also participated in the Germany-wide > \\u201cPlan E\\u201d consumer infor- mation campaign organized by stiftung ear. This campaign aims to raise aware- ness among consumers of how to properly return old appliances. The sales subsidiary in India operates an e-waste initiative to raise customers\\u2019 awareness of environmentally responsible recycling of old appliances and build a recycling supply chain to handle these products. Other sales subsidiaries offer dis- counts on new products. In the United Arab Emirates, for instance, consumers received a discount in 2019 when purchasing a vacuum cleaner if they returned their old vacuum cleaner \\u2013 no matter the brand \\u2013 to Miele. DISPOSAL OF MATERIALS RAISING CONSUMER AWARENESS OF RETURNS OF OLD APPLIANCES [GRI 417-1] It is not uncommon for elec- trical and electronic devices to be collected and resold illegally, for example in street campaigns, without the appropriate per- mits. This undermines the importance of the proper disposal of hazardous substances [GRI 417-1] New products, too, are tested with a view to their future disposal. Particular attention is paid to insulation materials, which help to lower the energy consumed by refrig- erators. For example, the process of breaking down vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) can give rise to particulates, which could cause prob- lems at the recycling plants if disposal is not carried out properly and the exhaust system is not designed correctly. However, research carried out by the European home appli- ance trade association APPLiA (previously SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling known as CECED) showed that if the plants are adequately impermeable and the filter systems are appropriate, then operations should run without any notable problems. TRANSPARENT LABELLING [GRI 417-1] The manufacturers organized within > APPLiA support waste manage- ment companies in doing their jobs properly. With this goal in mind, they have drafted codes of conduct on \\u201cend of life\\u201d labelling of appliances that contain VIPs and those containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, with Miele participating in a committee role. These voluntary pledges call for standard- ised labelling on the back of refrigerators, among other points. This is intended to make it possible to identify critical insulation materials and refrigerants, optimising envi- ronmentally responsible disposal. APPLiA and DIGITALEUROPE also operate the > I4R online information platform (Informa- tion for Recyclers). This website provides waste management companies and other interested parties with recycling information for various types of appliance directly from the manufacturer, including information on hazardous substances and components.

PRODUCTS & SERVICES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS CONTENTS 4949  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Natural resources and materials Efficient use of resources It takes natural resources and materials from all over the world to produce Miele appliances, from stainless steel for washing machines to plastic granulate for vacuum cleaners and glass ceramics for hobs. By the time these items arrive at the Miele locations, they have already undergone a multitude of process steps. Different sustainability considera- tions apply to these upstream value creation stages, depending on the material. Many nat- ural resources are only available in limited supply, even though demand is rising around the world. As resources become scarcer as a result, long-term availability and supply secu- rity are becoming increasingly important and posing more and more of a challenge. Miele is rising to this challenge. The > efficient use of materials and respon- sible handling of natural resources are key objectives and have been a firm fix- ture of the Miele strategy for years. In addition, Miele places great value on making the origins of materials and resources clear. Miele carries out regular checks to ensure that its direct suppliers are complying with > environmental and social standards. Hotspot analysis is carried out for individual components as and when necessary, such as if certain ecological or social risks are sus- pected in the natural resources supply chain. The various life cycle phases of the compo- nent are investigated with regard to specific sustainability issues. Despite Miele\\u2019s exten- sive efforts in this regard, it is currently not possible for the company to ensure com- plete traceability of all materials, given the globalised procurement markets and complex supply chains. However, direct sup- pliers are contractually obliged to confirm to Miele that their upstream suppliers are asked to comply with SA8000 standards. USE OF RESOURCES AND MATERIALS [GRI 102-9, 301-1/2] Miele obtains raw mate- rials such as stainless steel or plastic granulate, as well as components such as hoses and ball bearings, to manufacture its products. Entire products such as refrigerators, automatic coffee machines or microwave ovens are also sup- plied by > external manufacturing partners in accordance with Miele\\u2019s specifications. In the business year 2020, Miele obtained materials, components and domestic appli- ances with a value of around EUR 1.6 billion (2019: EUR 1.8 billion) from other compa- nies, including manufacturing materials with a value of around EUR 1.2 billion. In the business year 2020, Miele used a total of 127,238 tonnes of raw mate- rials (2019: 122,510 tonnes). The majority of these were metals (85 percent) in the form of iron and non-ferrous metals, steel and steel alloys. Apart from metals, Miele\\u2019s other main raw material is plastic granulate (15 percent). The company also uses auxil- iary and operating materials such as paints and oils, as well as electronic components. USE OF RECYCLABLE AND REUSABLE MATERIAL Miele appliances already contain a high pro- portion of recyclable materials and secondary raw materials \\u2013 i.e. raw materials which have already undergone a recycling process. The aim is to make even more efficient use of resources and ensure that as many mate- rials as possible are reused, which is why Miele checks that all of its materials are suit- able for use in a > closed recycling loop. This is an area that can give rise to con- flicting objectives. Using composite materials, for example, can save on resources, but can also lead to problems further down the line when materials have to be separated for recycling. Furthermore, not every mate- rial that can be easily recycled satisfies Miele\\u2019s RAW MATERIALS USED in tonnes 2020 18,641 TOTAL 127,238 108,597 Metals Plastic granulate requirements in relation to quality, durability and performance. Miele carefully weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of each material in order to maximise resource effi- ciency without compromising on quality. CORRECTLY USING RECYCLED PLASTICS [GRI 301-2] Plastics are an important com- ponent in many domestic appliances, 50  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility including vacuum cleaner casings, deter- gent drawers or the panels of washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers. Miele is always on the lookout for solu- tions involving > recycled materials so as to reduce the consumption of primary raw materials in this area too. Integrating recy- cled plastics into product development and production is a time-consuming and com- plex process. For example, the plastic has to suit the design of the respective appli- ance and pass durability tests. It is therefore very difficult to implement such a pro- cess into a pre-existing appliance series. In the long term, the aim is to expand the use of recycled materials wher- ever product characteristics allow for it and without undermining quality. In 2019, Miele committed to increasing the volume of plastic recyclates it uses to up to 7,500 tonnes by 2025. This figure cur- rently stands at roughly 194 tonnes. One of the areas where Miele already uses plastic recyclates is in its vacuum cleaner cable rewind systems. Additional pro- duction processes will be adjusted in the next few years. Recyclates are to be used in components or accessories for other product groups in addition to vacuum cleaner accessories in the near future. Pilot projects are currently under way. Each specific application has the poten- tial for the use of hundreds of kilograms of recyclate \\u2013 or even several tonnes. In 2020, Miele stepped up its efforts to coor- dinate with recyclate manufacturers and looked into material quality and durability. HIGH PROPORTION OF RECYCLED METAL [GRI 301-2] Stainless steel is a hugely impor- tant resource to Miele and can be recycled to a large extent, which is why Miele explicitly wel- comes efforts from its suppliers to process the highest possible proportion of recycled stainless steel while maintaining consistent quality. However, this proportion is set by the supplier and can vary for economic and tech- nological reasons for which Miele cannot be held responsible. As an example, it may be the case that recycled metals are no longer offered on the market at the required quality. PACKAGING: TESTING ALTERNATIVES, REDUCING WEIGHT The packaging of Miele domestic appli- ances must be robust enough to withstand the weight of the products. Stable mate- rials such as solid wood, cardboard, plastic moulded parts made from expanded polysty- rene (EPS) and polyethylene films are used in packaging, minimising damage during trans- port, storage and handling. A project team is tasked with continuously reviewing alter- native packaging materials so that Miele can switch to more environmentally friendly solu- tions in the long term. The most important criteria in this regard are high packaging stand- ards (product safety and low weight) and the smallest possible environmental footprint. In the business year 2020, the propor- tion of packaging weight in relation to all appliances produced by Miele was 9 percent (2019: 9.2 percent). 203,678 t of appliances produced in 2020 SAFE CLEANING AND CARE PRODUCTS Miele is the only household appliance man- ufacturer to offer a broad range of care and cleaning products which are perfectly aligned with machines and programme cycles. These products ensure top-class results and help customers use the right amounts to suit the degree of soiling. The demands on product packaging are high, for example with respect to durability, temperature resistance, protec- tion against light and product safety. Products are sent from Germany to all four corners of the world and need to withstand not only the transport itself, but also the changing cli- mates they are exposed to, which is why they are almost always packaged in polypropylene. This plastic meets these requirements perfectly and also has solid environmental characteris- tics, as it can be fully recycled. In addition, the cleaning products are extremely concentrated to reduce the amount of packaging required. The lids on Miele Caps laundry care capsules have been made from recycled plastic since this year. Miele Caps are small capsules pro- viding accurate and economical dosing of special detergent. This example of recy- cled packaging is set to be the first of many. ENSURING SUPPLY SECURITY Resources, materials and components must be available at the right time, in plen- tiful supply and at top standards of quality in order for Miele to use them in a suit- able manner. Miele has integrated early warning indicators for supply security into its > supplier management system to ensure that this is the case. The indi- cators have been used since 2016 for around 1,500 suppliers, who together account for more than 80 percent of the total purchasing volume. These indicators make it possible for Miele to identify potential risks which might jeopardise supply security at an early stage. Miele uses a software solution to record various hazards such as forces of nature (for example earthquakes, floods) or political risks. This process takes into account both country-specific and geo- graphical risks, as well as supplier-related risks such as creditworthiness. Pre- ventative measures, such as putting raw materials into storage at the supplier\\u2019s premises, are taken as soon as a pos- sible gap in supplies becomes apparent. As resources become ever scarcer, the increasing use of > recycled materials is also helping to ensure the supply of nec- essary raw materials in the long term. 51  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Supplier management Fair partnership with high standards Miele demands a lot from its suppliers in terms of quality and performance, but it also expects them to comply with high social and eco- logical standards. At the same time, Miele also understands that these requirements must be economically viable for suppliers. The aim is to establish long-term business relationships shaped by fairness, trust and collaboration, something that often begins in the area of > product development. Miele is constantly optimising its supplier man- agement system and adapting it to changing conditions. By doing so, Miele ensures con- sistently high product quality and long-term > supply security, as well as compliance with the latest sustainability requirements. The new German Supply Chain Act will require certain companies to ensure that human rights are respected in their supply chains from 2023. Under current legislation, the following aspects are considered relevant risk areas: forced labour, child labour, discrimination, prohibi- tion of freedom of association and problematic employment and working conditions. Miele has drawn on independent bodies to analyse these risk areas at its suppliers since 2004 and within the scope of official > SA8000 certification since 2008. Suppliers are also contractually obliged to comply with the same duties of care. PROCUREMENT CONCEPT WITH A LOCAL FOCUS [GRI 204-1] Miele products are mainly produced in Germany and other Euro- pean countries; 84 percent of deliveries to Miele plants \\u2013 based on purchasing volume \\u2013 come from Europe. This, cou- pled with > optimised transport logistics and the bundling of goods flows, saves on transport costs and reduces trans- port-related CO2 emissions. Local procurement is particularly impor- tant to the plants in China and the Czech Republic due to their distance from the other manufacturing locations. Since opening, the new plant in Poland has also looked to pro- cure materials, including washing machine doors and lids and packaging, from the local region in order to minimise transportation. The Uni\\u010dov plant in the Czech Republic also procures its packaging materials locally. SUPPLY SECURITY DURING A CRISIS The Covid-19 pandemic had a signifi- cant impact on the supply situation within the supply chain in 2020. In China, supply chains returned to normality relatively quickly. Italy, where Miele procures compo- 84% of deliveries to Miele plants \\u2013 based on purchasing volume \\u2013 come from Europe. nents from over 150 suppliers, proved to be the greatest challenge. In spite of the crisis, Miele was able to successfully avert supply risks and run its fleet of lorries at max- imum capacity. However, issues continue to plague the entire industry when it comes to procuring certain goods, including elec- tronic components and steel from India. Miele does not expect the situation to nor- malise again until 2022 at the earliest. Miele continues to expand its supply chain with the aim of implementing a dual- sourcing strategy that will allow it to avoid any future supply bottlenecks in sim- ilar situations. Dual sourcing involves procuring goods from two independent suppliers to ensure supply security even if one supplier is > unable to deliver. SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT: CHECKING SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA [GRI 308-2, 412-1, 414-2] Miele man- ages the selection of new suppliers and monitors existing suppliers with the aid of a comprehensive supplier manage- ment system. The system not only focuses on aspects such as supply availability, quality and price, it also checks compli- ance with Miele\\u2019s sustainability criteria. 52  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Compliance with > environmental, > social and economic sustainability criteria is monitored and verified several times over the course of a business relationship.

Registration Supplier self-assessment with query regarding sustainability criteria Update requested once a year SUSTAINABLE SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT Miele\\u2019s supplier management system is made up of six systematically intercon- nected elements (see diagram). It is based on material sustainability criteria and is adjusted to changing circumstances on an ongoing basis. Miele helps its pur- chasers and plants assess new suppliers by providing local support through its International Purchasing Offices (IPO) in Eastern Europe and Asia.

All suppliers, irrespec- tive of location, are required to submit a self-declaration regarding compliance with standardised sustainability requirements The self-declaration covers a number of areas, including certification, standards and additional employee-related issues, as well as compliance, prevention of cor- ruption, environmental management and climate action. The material group man- agers in Purchasing check whether the self-declarations are complete and plau- sible. In the event of non-compliance, the potential supplier is given the opportunity to implement the necessary corrective meas- ures within a reasonable amount of time and restore compliance with requirements. If this does not happen, Miele will not con- sider entering into a business relationship. 157 trained process auditors Before taking on a new manufacturing mate- rial supplier, a brief audit is carried out on site to assess compliance with process quality and sustainability standards. If Miele identifies non-conformities but feels that the supplier would otherwise be a useful partner, it works together with the supplier to find a solution. If there is no improvement, Miele blocks the applicant. Brief audits were performed online for the first time in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

These audits take place before production starts and while it is ongoing. Sustainability criteria are also mon- itored as part of these process audits. As at 31 December 2020, Miele had over 157 trained and active process auditors who con- ducted 90 internal and external audits in 2020. COMPLIANCE WITH SA8000 CRITERIA [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1] Miele places par- ticular emphasis on social standards. All of Miele\\u2019s suppliers worldwide must commit to complying with the following criteria within their own organisation in accordance with SA8000, an internationally recognised social standard, and must also monitor compli- ance on the part of their own suppliers: Ban on child labour Ban on forced or compulsory labour Health and safety in the workplace The right to freedom of associa- tion and collective bargaining Ban on discrimination Ban on disciplinary measures (in the standards on working hours Adherence to payment legislation Staff in the Purchasing department carry out a general risk classification for all sup- pliers on the basis of the SA8000 criteria. Suppliers are classified as low, medium or high risk depending on the country and the industry. There are only a small number of high-risk suppliers. Miele monitors these suppliers continuously and ensures that staff from the Purchasing department con- duct annual assessments, including by means of SA8000 audits. Any suspicions that standards have been violated trigger a multi-stage > escalation process. Miele revised its risk classification system in the reporting period and for the first time added a country risk component, which has been developed by the amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). This country classification covers the above cri- teria of the SA8000 social standard in accordance with the BSCI code. Clas- sifying country risk is aimed at helping companies to better identify potential social risks in connection with their pro- curement markets. This external instrument based on an independent database is a practical addition to Miele\\u2019s risk classifica- tion system. Any discrepancies between Miele\\u2019s risk classification and the country risk classification of amfori BSCI must be sense of physical punishment, mental 54  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility justified, explained and reviewed within the scope of an external SA8000 audit. In addition to the criteria based on SA8000, Miele requires its suppliers to provide information about which forms of employee participation the company has implemented and whether it has taken measures to ensure occupational health and safety and provide employees with additional training and support. ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL STANDARDS [GRI 308-1] As part of its efforts to main- tain ecological standards, Miele checks whether suppliers have implemented an environmental management system in line with standards such as ISO 14001, for example. The central supplier assessment system also includes information on whether the supplier uses resources in a sustain- able manner. Environmental requirements for materials and components are continu- ally adjusted to comply with the applicable legislation (such as the German Hazardous Materials Ordinance) and Miele\\u2019s internal regulations. To this end, Miele has its own company standard, which limits the use of certain substances in materials and compo- nents. Suppliers of manufacturing materials are only awarded contracts if they can con- firm compliance with this company standard. CORRUPTION PREVENTION AND COMPLIANCE Miele includes corruption prevention and com- pliance as part of its economic sustainability criteria. The criteria are based on the principles of the Global Compact of the United Nations (UN) and other > international guidelines. Staff in the Purchasing department must adhere to the > ethical guidelines for purchasing. Fair, transparent and partnership-based cooper- ation with suppliers is always paramount. The suppliers must state whether their com- pany participates in international or industry- related > compliance initiatives and whether they take measures to prevent corrup- tion \\u2013 for example, by providing an ombuds person for employees or considering the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) when selecting their upstream suppliers. Miele itself gives suppliers the opportunity to contact a specially appointed > ombudsperson. The ombudsperson acts as an independent contact person to employees, business partners and third parties should any suspicions of corruption or theft arise. Contact details for the ombudsperson are included in every Miele order. ESCALATION PROCESS IN THE CASE OF SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1] Suspicions or evi- dence that a supplier is violating SA8000 criteria or environmental standards trig- gers a multi-stage escalation process, which can culminate in the supplier being struck off the approved list and blocked for the future. Serious violations will generally lead to abso- lute and immediate termination of the contract. If investigations into a supplier reveal abnor- malities, the supplier may still be able to continue working with Miele depending on its subsequent development and improve- ment. However, the supplier in question must draw up an action plan in collaboration with Miele\\u2019s Purchasing and Quality Management departments and rectify the non-conform- ities in full within the specified period. Abnormalities were determined in relation to one supplier during the reporting period. The supplier in question was inspected according to the escalation plan and suc- cessfully implemented the measures agreed with Miele to rectify the issues. No sup- pliers were blocked in the reporting period.

The company is working to continuously reduce the envi- ronmental impact caused at its sites by waste water, waste and emissions, as well as energy-intensive processes and logis- tics. It manufactures all of its products in a resource-friendly manner, using as little energy as possible. Miele takes great pre- cautions here, ensuring that environmental protection is considered at an early stage when planning systems and processes. CERTIFIED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Miele uses an > integrated management system to manage operational environ- mental protection throughout the company. The environmental management system, which is certified according to ISO 14001 at all Miele production locations world- wide, is an important component of the integrated management system. It contains guidelines on how to deal with materials, water, waste and emissions. Miele also manages and monitors its environmental performance with the help of environmental performance indicators. The management system is reviewed at the beginning of each business year, with progress being meas- ured on the basis of the results of individual reviews conducted at the various Miele plants. These results are then used to set new objectives. The internal reviews are sup- plemented by external monitoring audits. Miele\\u2019s ISO 50001-certified > energy management system at all European pro- duction sites is another component of the integrated management system. This system helps the sites identify poten- tial for further energy savings and introduce corresponding measures. European sites are recertified in accor- dance with ISO 50001 every three years. The energy management system at Euro- pean sites was recertified at the end of 2020. The new washing machine plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, Poland, commenced operations in Sep- tember 2019 and achieved ISO 50001 certification in May 2021. The energy man- agement system at the Dongguan location in China is also based on ISO 50001. Management staff from different produc- tion sites regularly liaise on best practices. Miele reviews its energy management system annually by means of internal audits carried 918,000 \\u20ac was invested by Miele in environmental protection measures at its manufacturing sites in 2020. out by five specially trained employees. The audits performed in the business years 2019 and 2020 did not find any non-conformi- ties and only made recommendations for optimising individual process descriptions. Management has already begun imple- menting the improvements, which included coordinating the process of defining key performance indicators, as well as re - designing and simplifying energy reports. These audits ensure that Miele fulfils the national implementation of the 2015 Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), which requires companies to carry out an energy audit every four years. DIN EN 16247-1 energy audits are also performed at relevant sales subsidiaries. Energy management meetings took place online in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the number of meetings increased to four, with shorter intervals between meetings and more up-to-date discussions, which proved to be particularly advantageous with regard to the implementation of the ambitious new > sustainability strategy. In future, Miele plans to hold both online and in-person meetings depending on the subject matter. 56  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility plants and from Dongguan in China also reg- ularly attend the workshops in Germany.

Each area has its own responsible officers at the Miele head- quarters and at the individual plants. All of the plant officers report to the headquar- ters in G\\u00fctersloh. Information is shared between plants on a continuous basis, with operational environmental protection and energy management teams usually meeting twice a year at one of the German sites. These meetings are used to discuss individual efficiency projects, to provide information about changes in the legal framework and for further training. Representatives from other European [GRI 307-1] Miele operates a standardised legal management system for operational envi- ronmental protection, energy management and occupational health and safety at all of its German plants. This system monitors compli- ance with standards and legal requirements and continued to prove its worth during the reporting period. It guarantees consistent and simple compliance monitoring and makes it possible to additionally incorporate legal require- ments from official authorisations. Realising operational environmental protection remains the responsibility of each individual site. There were no recorded infringements of environ- mental regulations in the reporting period. PROFESSIONAL COMPLAINTS MANAGEMENT [GRI 413-1/-2] Employees, residents, busi- ness partners or other persons can report suspected violations of environmental pro- tection rules at any time and can get in touch with Miele by telephone, e-mail or letter. The headquarters or the plants are the main contacts for this purpose. The respon- sible department or the plant management will examine the situation and clarify or elim- inate the causes. In the event of a serious complaint, the company management will be involved at an early stage. No significant complaints concerning environmental emis- sions were received in the reporting period. MIELE SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE LIVING IN THE CITY What will sustainable and energy-efficient living look like in the future? One possible answer is provided by a pilot > project in Melbourne: a self-sufficient house built by eco-innovator Joost Bakker in 2020 \\u2013 sponsored by the Australian sales company. The zero-waste house has closed cycles, supplies the res- idents with renewable energy and is geared towards urban fruit and vegetable cultivation. In addition to domestic appliances for the laundry room, Miele also provided a complete kitchen, including a wine con- ditioning unit. All appliances used in the house are solar powered. After delays due to the pandemic, the house was ready for moving in at the end of 2020. CONTENTS 57  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Resource efficiency Waste avoidance and water management [GRI 306-1/-2] Miele preserves natural resources by using raw materials sparingly. However, its efforts also include avoiding waste and minimising water consumption, not only protecting the environment in the process, but also helping to ensure supply security and cut costs too. Miele continu- ously optimises its production processes for this purpose, reusing materials where pos- sible and recycling where not. Preferentially, materials are reused immediately or recycled. WASTE AVOIDANCE AND EXTENSIVE USE OF RECYCLING [GRI 306-1/-2] Waste can never be completely avoided in manufacturing. At Miele, waste is carefully separated into reusable containers on site as soon as it is produced. Miele uses specialist companies to dispose of waste. In the business year 2020, Miele plants pro- duced a total of 37,413 tonnes of waste, around 9.4 percent more than in 2019 (34,190 tonnes). This increase was due to a rise in production activity, as well as a greater volume of chrome steel waste from the commissioning of a new welding system in G\\u00fctersloh. The resulting scrap was recycled. However, the new system has also increased the level of vertical integra- tion at the G\\u00fctersloh site, as the parts (cast flanges) can now be produced in-house rather than being purchased. Another reason for the increase in waste was the soil extracted for a new supply duct at the Lehrte site.

Besides the legal requirements defined in the German Waste Management Act (KrWG), the audits also look at additional aspects such as whether waste is checked, whether approvals have been provided for waste disposal facilities, what condition the laboratories are in and whether the scales have been calibrated properly. Waste disposal companies are responsible for recording waste output from Miele plants. When it comes to transporting hazardous waste, Miele only employs the services of specialist companies both in Ger- many and at its sites outside of Germany. Miele itself does not export any waste. A total of 95 percent of the waste produced at Miele\\u2019s plants worldwide was recycled in the business years 2019 and 2020. The volume of hazardous waste recycled and disposed of in the reporting period fell by a small margin of 4.2 percent from 2,687 tonnes to 2,574 tonnes in the reporting period. Numerous waste treatment facilities are cur- rently in the process of setting new acceptance criteria for recycling processes. In the past, sludge from Miele\\u2019s waste water processing facilities and foundry was recycled for use as a construction additive. This construction additive is used at landfill sites to secure waste and build access routes. With the number of landfill sites decreasing in Germany, this form of recycling will no longer be available in the future, which is why processing landfill waste will be classified as a waste disposal process rather than a recycling process moving forward. This would result in the share of Miele waste that is recycled falling markedly. RAISING AWARENESS AMONG EMPLOYEES [GRI 306-1/-2] All Miele employees need to pull their weight to ensure that waste is avoided as much as possible and disposed of prop- erly when it is produced. Miele has various measures to raise employee awareness of this topic, including noticeboards on how to properly separate waste at production sites. 1) See page 97 for further explanation. 58  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Miele\\u2019s sales subsidiary in Canada has introduced a system of waste separation and organised an employee competition to reduce waste. The Russian sales subsidiary has been working on measures to raise employee awareness of the environment in their day- to-day work since 2017 as part of the ECO Office project. In 2020, the office replaced single-use cutlery and plates, which were commonplace, with ceramic tableware and metal cutlery and installed a water dispenser. The same measures were intro- duced at the sales subsidiary in Italy. Both sales subsidiaries saw a marked decline in the use of plastic single-use bottles. The Australian sales subsidiary con- ducted an online survey on employees\\u2019 printing habits, which focused on ways of reducing the number of printed documents and general paper consumption. Around 250 employees took part in the survey in 2020, providing a great many ideas and sug- gestions. The company is currently working on a detailed proposal for implementation. SYSTEMATIC WATER MANAGEMENT [GRI 303-1] Miele is reliant on water throughout its value chain. Plants require cooling water to manufacture Miele appli- ances, and water is also needed to operate kitchens and bathroom facilities and for watering green spaces. The produc- tion plants in G\\u00fctersloh and Bra\\u0219ov cover most of their water requirements from their own well facilities, while other plants draw water from municipal systems. Miele strives to consistently reduce its water consumption through systematic water man- agement. All water-saving measures are, of course, implemented without affecting drinking water hygiene. As an example, Miele has spent the past few years sepa- rating its drinking water and firefighting water facilities at its G\\u00fctersloh site, which had pre- viously been operated as a single system. Miele installed smaller pipes for the drinking water system, allowing water consump- tion to be reduced. The old drinking water pipes were oversized for current drinking water requirements and had to be flushed out very often to prevent bacteria from building up. The large-diameter pipe network had been originally installed to provide effective and rapid access to large volumes of water to fight fires. However, a new 1,250 cubic metre water tank has since been installed to provide water for firefighting from 2021. Water abstraction per tonne of product climbed from 1.85 cubic metres in 2019 to 1.93 cubic metres in the business year 2020. In absolute terms, water abstraction increased from 358,789 cubic metres to 393,827 cubic metres year on year in the business year 2020 due to the repeated exchange of water in the cooling tower for hygiene reasons and the increased use of rinsing water during the commissioning of a cooling system in G\\u00fcter- sloh, among other factors. In addition, the new plant in Poland was included in the data for the first time in 2020. Another reason for the increased water consumption is the dry summer in 2020 and the need to water green spaces as a result. Drip irrigation sys- tems have been installed at some sites to reduce water consumption in the future. Plants outside of Germany have also imple- mented a water management system, including measures to reduce water con- sumption. In Dongguan, China, for instance, water meters have been installed to analyse water usage and set consumption targets. WASTE WATER: REGULAR MEASUREMENTS [GRI 303-1/-2, 306-3] The plants in G\\u00fcter- sloh, Oelde, Lehrte and B\\u00fcrmoos are able to discharge their waste water into the public sewer system due to its high quality. These indirect discharges are subject to the waste water regulations of the respective munic- ipalities. Waste water is treated before it is discharged, with heavy metals being pre- cipitated using lime milk in G\\u00fctersloh and Oelde to filter these substances out of the waste water. Precipitation is a chemical pro- cess for isolating a dissolved substance from a solution. The heavy metals are then deposited as particles and filtered out by the filters. In addition, the waste water is also neutralised. This all ensures that Miele complies with the limits stipulated by munic- ipal waste water regulations. Miele regularly conducts internal analysis and submits random samples to the authorities for anal- ysis to monitor the quality of this process. As at all other Miele plants, regular sam- ples are taken to ensure that the water WASTE WATER in cubic metres 2020 362,702 2019 313,264 quality is perfect. In the reporting period, there were no notable or significant cases of municipal limits being exceeded. At the Bra\\u015fov plant, domestic waste water is treated in the plant\\u2019s own biological treat- ment plant and before being discharged into the B\\u00e2rsa stream. But that is set to change from the end of 2021, when Miele waste water will be discharged through a new sewer system to a new public treatment plant, where it will be treated. So far, there are no manufacturing processes at the new Ksaw- er\\u00f3w plant that produce technical waste water. Other waste water produced by this plant is discharged into a municipal treat- ment plant through the public sewer system. On account of the increase in water con- sumption in the business year 2020, the waste water of all Miele plants climbed to 362,702 cubic metres in the business year 2020 (2019: 313,264 cubic metres). 59  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Energy and emissions Focus on climate action Climate change is one of the greatest chal- lenges we face, and climate action is one of Miele\\u2019s key sustainability tasks. That is why Miele has refined its climate action strategy during the reporting period, defining ambi- tious new goals. The climate action strategy centres on avoiding and reducing CO2 emissions and compensating where such measures are not (yet) possible. The pri- mary instruments in Miele\\u2019s strategy are investment in efficiency measures, the expansion of in-house energy generation and the targeted reduction of emissions in the upstream and downstream value chain. CO2 NEUTRALITY FOR ALL SITES FROM 2021 As part of its climate strategy, Miele has decided to shift to carbon-neutral production from 2021, as relates to the company\\u2019s own emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions attrib- utable to energy suppliers (Scope 2). At the same time, the company aims to cut the CO2 emissions of its global production and sales sites, including the vehicle fleet, by 50 per- cent in absolute terms by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. To do so, Miele will be investing primarily in energy efficiency and gener- ating its own renewable energy at its sites. ELEMENTS OF THE MIELE CLIMATE STRATEGY Energy-efficient products Appropriate management mechanisms (internal CO2 price) Energy-efficient production The strategy was adopted by the Exec- utive Board in October 2020.

But they can also improve the day-to-day lives of people, too. Since 2021, Miele has been involved in a project to equip rural households in Nepal with small biogas plants as part of the com- pany\\u2019s CO2 compensation project. Instead of using firewood to cook, and producing harmful smoke, fam- ilies use biogas. In addition, residual materials from the plants can be used as fertiliser, increasing agri- cultural yields. People are no longer reliant solely on wood, meaning that deforestation has also declined, helping to preserve species diversity and coun- teract soil erosion. A total of 350 biogas plants have been constructed with Miele\\u2019s assistance.

Other projects are in the pipeline, both at Miele produc- tion sites and at sales companies. In addition, Miele is in the process of switching its energy supply to fully renewable sources, with all global sites set to procure green electricity by the end of 2021. The plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, which was opened at the start of 2019, has been using green electricity since produc- tion operations commenced. All production sites in Germany, as well as those in B\\u00fcrmoos, Bra\\u015fov and Uni\\u010dov, have been operating on renewable electricity since 2020. Many inter- national sales companies, such as those in the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as the Steelco Group, also operate on green electricity exclusively. projects in the United States to plant new hardwood forests in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which is one of North America\\u2019s most important deciduous forest ecosystems. PROMOTING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES Miele also supports innovative tech- nological approaches to reducing or sequestering carbon. One project in Austria and Germany supports the storage of carbon for agricultural use. In this project, vegetable carbon is being used for long-term carbon storage, and is applied to the soil, improving soil fer- tility and increasing humus levels in the process. Miele co-finances the project. REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF PRODUCTS COMPENSATION OF UNAVOIDABLE EMISSIONS Miele compensates for unavoidable emis- sions by purchasing high-quality CO2 certificates and investing in global climate action projects, including a solar-thermal project in India and a biogas project in Nepal. In Nicaragua, Miele supports an initiative for sustainable coffee growing. The tech- nical and financial support provided by Miele helps Nicaraguan farmers manage their plan- tations in a more environmentally friendly way. Other initiatives include reforesta- tion projects in Uganda, a country that has lost more than 40 percent of its forests in the past 20 years. Miele also supports The majority of the CO2 emissions that make up Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint are produced during the use of products (Scope 3.11) and during the purchasing of goods and services (Scope 3.1), both of which are areas where a further reduc- tion of CO2 emissions is necessary. Initial pilot projects are currently under way. THE JOURNEY TO THE CLIMATE STRATEGY Allocating emissions to certain activities is a key part of effective climate action.

The next step was to simulate and model potential measures to cut Scope 1, 2 and 3 emis- sions and the resulting costs. At this stage, Miele also looked into potential strategies to achieve carbon neutrality through ener- gy-efficiency measures, ways to increase own energy generation, opportunities to increase the amount of green electricity and possibilities for carbon compensation. SYSTEMATIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT The energy industry in Germany and Europe is undergoing a structural shift towards solar and wind energy. However, both of these renewable sources are weather-de- pendent and therefore volatile. Energy bottlenecks must be avoided, and avail- ability and stable prices secured. Hence why it is important for Miele to adapt to the changes by implementing new energy storage concepts and efficient internal man- agement mechanisms. Miele firmly believes that the only way to absorb the differences between volatile supply and uniform demand is to store energy in the form of hydrogen, which is why the company is investing in the development of hydrogen-based energy storage solutions. Dr Reinhard Zinkann is a co-signatory to the white paper \\u201cAufbruch in die Zukunft: Transfor- mationspfade f\\u00fcr nachhaltige industrielle Projekte in Nordrhein-Westfalen\\u201d (Journey into the future: transformation path- ways for sustainable industrial projects in North Rhine-Westphalia), which con- tains 13 specific project proposals for the further development of hydrogen tech- nology. The paper is the result of top-level meetings initiated by the state gov- ernment of North Rhine-Westphalia. Energy storage is an important piece of the puzzle, but efficient energy flows are also crucial. Thanks to the ISO 50001 energy management standard, which has been applied since its introduction in 2011, Miele has been able to transparently doc- ument energy flows at its sites and, in doing so, uncover potential for improve- ments in efficiency. Within this framework, the company has also set up a number of > performance indicators to mon- itor achievement of efficiency targets and plan infrastructure measures. The foundry and enamelling processes are particu- larly energy-intensive parts of production. ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE Energy efficiency has always been a top priority at Miele, and not just with the company\\u2019s products. In the early 1980s, Miele began designing new build- ings with more efficient low-temperature systems and facilities. Nowadays, this tech- nology is being used on an increasing basis in modern heating networks. Miele has its own electricity grids at its plants and sites. Featuring 40 transformers, the grid at the G\\u00fctersloh site is comparable to that of a small town. Miele also feeds electricity into its internal grids with its cogeneration plants in B\\u00fcnde and Bielefeld, and the pho- tovoltaic system in G\\u00fctersloh. This kind of infrastructure has been a resounding suc- cess so far, which is why Miele believes that small electricity grids with decentral- ised energy generation and storage can play a major role in the energy transition. In G\\u00fctersloh, Miele is also a partner in the city\\u2019s heat distribution network, with waste heat from a high-efficiency gas-fired power station used to heat the entire G\\u00fctersloh site since 2008 \\u2013 and improving the energy yield of the power station turbines in the pro- cess. Miele continues to hold small boiler systems on standby as a contingency for its production activities. The family-owned company is in constant dialogue with dis- trict heating provider Fernw\\u00e4rmegesellschaft G\\u00fctersloh to increase the efficiency of the network and reveal untapped potential. ENERGY EFFICIENCY COMPETENCY NETWORK Maintaining and facilitating dialogue is an area of extreme importance to Miele, which is why the company has its own com- petency network on the issue of energy efficiency. This network is geared towards promoting dialogue among Miele plants DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION Proportion of total energy consumption as a percentage Direct energy consumption 11.6 0.6 2020 58.4 29.4 Electricity Natural gas District heating Heating oil CONTENTS 62  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility and creating greater synergy effects at an international level. The network\\u2019s experts form various working groups to look into issues or technologies such as com- pressed air or refrigeration systems. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the network met up as often as three times a year. In 2020, the meetings were organised online, and members of the network quickly realised that online meetings can also have added bene- fits: Teams met more frequently, the issues they discussed were more relevant and out- comes were more effective. Competency network meetings in the reporting period focused on improving and enhancing the sys- tems used to measure energy consumption.

Total energy consumption is made up of direct energy consumption (heating oil, natural gas) and indirect consumption (district heating and electrical energy); see diagram below. The > Key figures section includes a detailed breakdown and explanations. Specific energy consumption per produced appli- ance was reduced further in the reporting period. In the business year 2020, the lion\\u2019s share of energy requirements (86 per- cent) were covered by green electricity. In 2021, all sites use green electricity.

Employees can also com- plete an e-learning module on the subject, or find a broad range of information on how to save energy in their day-to-day work on the company intranet. The information is pre- pared for different target groups, such as office personnel and employees working in plant engineering, and is continuously updated. Tips include how to save energy through correct ventilation and heating. CURRENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION [GRI 305-1/-2/-3/-5] Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint is calculated on the basis of the international Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. It is prepared using a market-based approach, which applies the specific emission factors of energy suppliers. Emissions consist of direct emissions from oil and gas consumption as well as Miele\\u2019s fleet of vehicles (Scope 1), indirect emissions from electricity and dis- trict heating (Scope 2) and indirect Scope 3 emissions. Besides purchased goods and services and the use of sold products, Scope 3 emissions now also include capital goods, fuel- and energy-related emis- sions, transportation and distribution, waste, business travel, commuting, rented facil- ities and how sold products are handled at the end of their lifecycle. These emis- sions are reported in the carbon footprint diagram under \\u201cScope 3: All others\\u201d.

Direct emissions (Scope 1) were cut by 8 percent in the same period. This is due to the reduced consumption of natural gas and heating oil and the pandemic-based decline in fleet mileage. Miele reduced indirect emissions (Scope 2) by a much larger margin of 65 percent on account of most of Miele\\u2019s sites covering their energy requirements with green electricity (86 percent). Moreover, electricity and district heat consumption fell further year on year. remaining 30 percent are currently in the process of being converted to use R290-grade fluid. Appliances produced for commercial applications. will only be filled with R600a refrigerant from 2021. Motor production at the Euskirchen site produces volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs), but these pollutants are eliminated by a post-combustion process, bringing the total amount in exhaust air below legal limits. HOW TO DEAL WITH ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GASES AND OTHER EMISSIONS [GRI 305-7] In addition to CO 2 emis- sions, Miele also strives to reduce other greenhouse gases and harmful emissions. Refrigerants containing chlorofluorocar- bons (CFCs) are still occasionally used at Miele plants: for example for air-con- ditioning technology, compressed air dryers and small-scale systems such as climate-controlled chests. These refrig- erants are gradually being replaced by more climate-friendly alternatives. Miele products also contain refrigerants, but since 2020 only R600a-grade fluid has been used worldwide. In 2020, 70 per- cent of heat pump tumble dryers were also produced using the environmentally friendly refrigerant R290 (propane).

The task of the logistics depart- ment is to make sure that Miele is able to supply its products on time to sales sub- sidiaries and customers all over the world. Miele has set itself the objective of mini- mising the impact of this level of traffic on the environment and the climate as much as possible, as well as optimising the nec- essary shipments. This is achieved using state-of-the-art logistics processes from the central Miele logistics centre in G\\u00fctersloh. Most delivery routes are relatively short: eight out of twelve of the Miele production sites are located in Germany, with the fur- thest situated 215 kilometres away from G\\u00fctersloh. Europe continues to be the key market for Miele products, as over 80 per- cent of sales are generated there \\u2013 and one third in Germany alone. The neces- sary shipments and deliveries are managed efficiently. In addition, Miele aims to uti- lise modes of transport that generate the lowest possible level of emissions. Carbon emissions are a significant selection crite- rion for Miele when it comes to awarding contracts to transport service providers. The company avoids the use of air freight as far as possible and carefully reviews any instances of transportation by air. SHIPPING THE MOST IMPORTANT MODE OF TRANSPORT Transport volumes rose by 12 percent in the business year 2020 to 1,008 million tonne-kilometres (compared to the busi- ness year 2019). This includes transport on own account and deliveries to Miele sales subsidiaries (outbound). The increase is mainly due to the positive sales develop- ment at sales subsidiaries overseas, as well as in Southern and Eastern Europe. Miele successfully maintained the propor- tion of its outbound shipments transported by ship and rail at an extremely high level of over 85 percent. Once again, an extremely low percentage of shipments were made by air (0.8 percent). Of Miele\\u2019s transport on own account, 43 percent was com- pleted by ship and 57 percent by lorry. CALCULATING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND OTHER EMISSIONS [GRI 305-3] Miele uses software to determine the environmental impact of its transport logistics that calculates the transport volume and greenhouse gas emissions based on the OUTBOUND TRANSPORT VOLUME in shares (related to tonne-kilometres) 2 1 14 2020 83 by ship by rail by lorry by air EN 16258 CEN standard. In the business year 2020, transport-related emissions increased by 3 percent, from 60,235 tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2019 to 62,212 tonnes CO2-equivalent. These emissions include outbound logistics, global distribution and transport on own account. The rise in CO2 emissions was much less significant than the increase in transport volume. Noise also forms part of transport-related emissions. Noise emissions are legally regulated in Germany and in many other countries. Certain noise thresholds must not be exceeded, especially at night, to protect the public and the areas around the plants from harmful noise-related environmental effects. This is monitored on the basis of a noise register containing all noise sources. Miele adhered to all requirements during the reporting period. OPTIMAL USE OF TRANSPORT VEHICLE CAPACITIES A key way of reducing the environmental impact of transport is the optimal utilisa- tion of the means of transport in procurement and distribution logistics. During the reporting period, transport vehicles operated at 90 per- cent capacity in procurement and 91 percent CONTENTS 65  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Logistics and mobility TRANSPORT-RELATED CO2-EQUIVALENT tonnes CO2-equivalent 2020 62,212 2019 60,235 in distribution logistics.

When it comes to deliveries to customers, Miele is continu- ously analysing demand and capacities and will adjust processes if necessary to achieve the best possible capacity utilisation. is also working together with automotive manufacturers as a test partner for sus- tainable light commercial vehicle (LCV) systems and is aiming to become one of the first companies to use electric LCVs. CARBON-NEUTRAL RAIL JOURNEYS AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT OFFERS FOR EMPLOYEES [GRI 305-3] Miele employees are encour- aged to choose public transport for business trips whenever possible. They should use rail travel for longer business trips and avoid air travel unless it is strictly necessary due to time constraints or for sched- uling reasons. Long-distance journeys with Deutsche Bahn as part of the \\u201cbahn.cor- porate\\u201d corporate customer programme are carbon-neutral. The reduction in busi- ness travel, particularly by air, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, has led to a decline in CO2 emissions and had a pos- itive impact on Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint. used these tickets to commute to work in 2019, but this figure fell to 862 in 2020. Subsidised public transport tickets are also available to employees in Austria, China and at the Danish sales subsid- iary. In B\\u00fcrmoos, Bra\\u015fov and Dongguan, Miele provides a dedicated bus service for its employees. Furthermore, all trainees in B\\u00fcrmoos are given a ticket that entitles them to free public transport throughout the state of Salzburg \\u2013 both for commuting and for personal use. Sales subsidiaries also reduce their CO2 emissions through video conferences and remote working. MIELE FLEET TRANSPORT-RELATED CO2-EQUIVALENT in percentages [GRI 305-1] The Miele fleet primarily com- prises cars and vans for customer service. When vehicles need to be replaced, Miele chooses low-carbon models. Besides con- ventional low-emission models, Miele also offers employees at least one fully elec- tric vehicle in each vehicle class. Miele has also been offering regular envi- ronmentally friendly driving courses in Germany for a number of years now as part of its > open training concept. The ECO training was held as normal in 2019, but had to be cancelled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is set to return to the calendar from 2021. 17 2019 49 17 2020 50 Miele has set itself the target of reducing the > carbon emissions of its fleet by at least 30 percent worldwide by 2030 compared to the 21,920 tonnes of CO2-equivalent generated in 2019.

This includes those working for the following subsidiaries: Steelco, Yujin, Agri- lution, WaschMal, MChef, Miele Operations and Payment Solutions. In 2020, Miele hired 466 employees, or a 2.3 percent increase over the previous year (20,478 employees). As at the reference date, Miele employed 10,968 people in Ger- many, a decrease of 20 employees or 0.2 percent from the previous year. training, qualification and talent management, as well as HR management. In Germany, it is responsible for identifying and hiring suitable applicants. The sales subsidiaries have their own HR managers and/or departments. The central HR department coordinates its activi- ties regularly with the individual departments, local HR departments, the management of the sales subsidiaries and the works council. In industrialised countries, demographic change is intensifying the competition for well-trained specialists. Global markets and increasing digital connectivity are also changing the demands employees face. Strategic human resources management constantly aims to attract a sufficient number of qualified, creative and enthusiastic minds to the company and to ensure their long-term loyalty, even under the present conditions. This is crucial in supporting Miele\\u2019s efforts to be an innovation leader in the industry on a lasting basis. The focus is on the short-, medium- and long-term need for employees in all areas of the company.

The Miele employer brand is a central element of the Human Resources strategy and helps make Miele even more appealing to highly qualified young pro- fessionals. The company is increasingly looking not only for candidates with tech- nical profiles, but IT and digitalisation professionals as well. Miele posts ads for these prospective employees, particu- larly on the internet and on social media. STRONG IDENTIFICATION WITH MIELE Since 2012, Miele has carried out employee surveys to measure how satis- fied employees are in their workplace and how strongly they identify with the com- pany. Miele focuses on different issues and metrics depending on the location. 240 anniversaries were celebrated in 2020. the company placed 41st. Some 143,000 company evaluations were considered for the study. Another magazine, stern, ranked Miele the 25th most popular employer and first in the \\u201cDurable Con- sumer Goods\\u201d category in 2019. This survey involved 45,000 employees in Germany. STAFF RETENTION: LOW TURNOVER RATES, LOTS OF ANNIVERSARIES [GRI 401-1] Miele is traditionally characterised by a high rate of staff retention. Most employees stay with Miele for many years. The staff turnover rate at the German locations stood at 1.33 percent in the business year 2020 (2019: 1.76 percent). Numerous anniversaries were celebrated in the reporting period. In the business year 2020, 240 employees worldwide celebrated 25, 40 and even 50 years with the company (2019: 319 employees with anniversaries). Local celebrations were postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. mented, helping save over 1.9 million euros. A total of 371,000 euros were paid out as bonuses in the business year 2020. The Miele idea management programme is being fully digitalised by stages. This will enable greater transparency and process speed and may make it easier to share knowledge. In 2018, Miele renamed its corporate sugges- tion scheme, dubbing it \\u201cIdee M\\u201d (\\u201cIdea M\\u201d), while also modernising various processes in an effort to respond even more flexibly to ideas when they are received. Idee M launched a campaign called \\u201c120 Jahre Immer Besser\\u201d (\\u201c120 Years, Ever Better\\u201d), inviting employees to win special prizes if their suggestions were accepted by the idea management pro- gramme. All entrants also received physical prizes and a 20 percent addition to the usual idea bonus. During the campaign, 1,521 ideas were submitted and then reviewed and evaluated by experts with an eye to implemen- tation. In 2019, 2,983 ideas were submitted, and the number for 2020 was 1,659. The sharp change was due to the reduction in on-site work brought on by the pandemic. The last surveys were conducted in 2018, eliciting feedback from employees of sales subsidiaries and the Bra\\u015fov, Dongguan and Uni\\u010dov plants. These surveys showed high levels of identification and engagement among the international workforce, well above the average of the manufacturing industry. The next worldwide survey is scheduled for 2021. In 2019, German business and career mag- azine Focus Business ranked Miele 15th among Germany\\u2019s top employers, a sig- nificant gain over the previous year, when EMPLOYEE IDEAS PAY OFF Miele\\u2019s idea management programme is one of the ways employees can help shape the com- pany.

PRO-GE is the responsible trade union in Austria, with KOVO acting as our labour partner in the Czech Republic. The plant in Bra\\u015fov, Romania, is subject to a collective labour agreement that governs the funda- mental demands, as well as the organisation and structure of employment relationships. Working conditions for employees in Ger- many, Austria, the Czech Republic and Romania are therefore all regulated in collec- tive bargaining agreements, equating to a 66.8 percent share of all Miele employees (as at 31 December 2020). The employment relationship between Miele and the tempo- rary agency workers employed at Miele\\u2019s German locations is governed by the collec- tive wage agreements concluded by the agencies themselves. Works councils look after the interests of employees in Germany and at our Czech plant, as well as at some of our sales subsid- iaries, such as in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Employees at our plant in Dongguan, China, for example, have enjoyed representation since 2009. Such representation is not mandatory under local law. The employee representatives there meet with the HR department on a monthly basis to discuss suggestions and deal with potential areas of conflict. The interests of the employees at the plant in Uni\\u010dov, Czech Republic, are represented through the KOVO union and in regular meetings between internal employee representatives and plant management. At smaller sales subsidiaries, such as those in Poland or Ireland, the dialogue between employees and manage- ment is a direct and ongoing process, but has not been formally defined. SOCIAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-1/-2] Miele is respectful and responsible in its dealings with employees. This is a key feature of the Miele corporate culture, and one that has been under- scored since back in 2004 by the company\\u2019s voluntary pledge to fulfil the internationally rec- ognised SA8000 social standard. This has been officially certified since 2008. The standard includes the requirement to observe decent working conditions, to guarantee freedom of association and the prohibition of child labour and discrimination. An external service pro- vider performs a monitoring audit every six months to determine whether this standard is met. All plant locations are > SA8000 certified and undergo recertification every three years. The most recent scheduled recertification took place in 2019; the plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, Poland, is slated for recertification in 2022. It goes without saying that Miele respects human rights in all its business activities. Miele conveys this pledge to employees as part of the company philosophy right from the beginning of their employment. In the reporting period, 115 managers and employees from HR were trained with an online learning programme on the German General Act on Equal Treatment (Allge- meines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, or AGG). Since the programme was introduced, a total of 1,649 employees have completed the training. Software-based training is also held 4,126 employees have been digitally trained on the Code of Conduct. on the company\\u2019s code of conduct. So far, 4,126 have received training worldwide, 699 of them during the reporting period. Miele also requires its suppliers to comply with > social criteria. Miele purchasing employees receive regular information to raise aware- ness of this topic. Venues for providing information include the semiannual meetings of SA8000 management representatives, the quarterly meetings of the social performance teams and the company-wide SA8000 infor- mation portals. In 2019, the company began holding meetings with the central purchasing team every six weeks to optimise procure- ment processes in keeping with ethics standards. The focus here is on cross- plant coordination and on implementation of SA8000 requirements by suppliers, taking country-specific circumstances into account. Miele also provides new hires with infor- mation about complying with social and ethical standards during the two-day \\u201cWelcome@Miele\\u201d event. New Miele employees get to know the company and its culture in depth during this onboarding event. TRANSPARENT COMPLAINTS PROCESS [GRI 406-1] Every employee in Germany has the right to turn to a complaints office, which offers help as the first point of contact in the case of suspected discrim- ination. In accordance with the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), the works council is involved in handling and evalu- ating incoming complaints. Miele has set up dedicated complaints offices, each of which is staffed by one man and one 70  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement woman, at every company location in Germany. All complaints are naturally con- fidential. Similar systems are in place at the international sites. The complaints office works closely with the aggrieved person to review the circumstances surrounding the complaint. Wherever possible, the results of the review are communicated within one month. Information on how to contact the individual complaints offices is accessible to all employees on the intranet. In addi- tion, employees or business partners of Miele or other third parties can contact an ombudsperson if they believe there are indi- cations that criminal laws have been violated within the company\\u2019s sphere of influence. In the reporting period, the com- plaints offices in Germany received a total of one AGG complaint related to gender and ethnic background. In this case, remedial measures were taken and further support was offered. FAIR PAY \\u2013 NATURALLY [GRI 202-1] Miele believes in paying all employees an appropriate wage or salary based on collective and corporate agree- ments. Such pay meets or exceeds > the real-world living wage at the loca- tion in question and comes with a variety of voluntary benefits. In keeping with the founders\\u2019 philosophy, such benefits are paid regardless of the current eco- nomic climate or business performance. The company stands by its pledge to be an attractive employer, even \\u2013 and espe- cially \\u2013 in tough economic times. A LONG TRADITION OF COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS [GRI 201-3, 401-2, 404-2] Miele has offered its employees a company pension scheme since 1929. Today, Miele supports its employees in Germany in saving for retire- ment through a variety of models, such as private pension schemes or deferred com- pensation. Depending on the company agreement and collective wage agreement, employees in Germany can pay up to 4 per- cent of the contribution assessment ceiling for pension insurance (Western states) into a tax-privileged pension insurance fund. Miele grants special one-off payments and allowances for health treatments and dental prostheses that go beyond the stat- utory requirements and the provisions of the collective wage agreements, as well as payments in the event of births, marriages, deaths, milestone birthdays and work anni- versaries. In addition, employees receive benefits and individually negotiated perks such as meal subsidies and coverage of travel expenses. The company provides its former and active employees with modern health insurance coverage through its com- pany insurance provider. Some sales subsidiaries also have separate health insurance programmes for their employees. They also provide their employees with the option of discounted supplemental insurance policies, such as denture insur- ance. In some cases, employees can also take advantage of pension, health, invalidity and survivors insurance. 1929 was the year Miele introduced company retirement benefits. Both in Germany and internationally, benefits are granted regardless of whether employees have full-time, part-time, tem- porary or permanent contracts. Rules on company pensions vary internationally due to local differences and legal requirements. GOOD INTEGRATION OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES [GRI 102-8] In the business year 2020, the share of the workforce in Germany con- sisting of temporary employees stood at 5 percent, up from 3.4 percent in 2019. In a company-wide agreement signed in 2007, Miele committed to only work with recruit- ment agencies that have concluded a collective wage agreement. This regulates pay and the industry supplement, which is between 15 and 30 percent of the base pay under the collective agreement for the metal industry. In the company-wide agree- ment, Miele also agreed to increase the pay of temporary agency employees by an addi- tional 6 to 8 percent (scaled according to duration of the employment period). 71  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement AWARDS: RECOGNITION FOR HR POLICIES Miele has received several awards for its exemplary HR work.

Employees in Germany may take advan- tage of flexitime, provided there are no production-related reasons or other urgent considerations to the contrary. In the business year 2020, the percentage of employees with flexitime stood at 59 percent. The share of employees in semi-retire- ment stood at 2.9 percent in the business year 2019 and at 3.3 percent in 2020. \\u201crealm of ideas\\u201d.

The Miele nursery received \\u201cHaus der kleinen For- scher\\u201d (House of Little Scientists) certification in 2019 and is thus officially designated as a centre for youthful knowledge and explo- ration. This coveted designation goes to institutions that place special emphasis on early education in science, technology, engi- neering and mathematics (STEM). Despite the tough conditions in 2020, the centre was able to offer at least emergency care at all times throughout the year.

As at 31 December 2020, 553 of these people remained with the company. Eight women and 14 men left the company. ENHANCING THE COMPATIBILITY OF WORK AND FAMILY LIFE MIELE NURSERY IN G\\u00dcTERSLOH [GRI 401-3, 404-2] Miele offers employment models with flexible working hours so as to make it easier for its employees to main- tain a healthy work-life balance. The models provide various part-time or full-time employ- ment arrangements. In the business year 2019, the proportion of employees working part-time in Germany was 8.0 percent, while in the business year 2020, this figure stood at 8.2 percent. Some 903 people are cur- rently employed part-time in a variety of Miele operates its own nursery in G\\u00fctersloh, its headquarters and home to its largest site.

A healthy workforce is the foundation of long-term success for any company. Supporting and maintaining employees\\u2019 physical and mental abilities to perform is therefore the very highest priority. The basis for these efforts is a thoughtfully conceived, prevention-driven health man- agement programme, combined with safe and ergonomically designed workplaces. A CLEAR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY ORGANISATION [GRI 403-1/-4/-5/-7/-8] As an employer, Miele is responsible for its employees\\u2019 safety. To keep everyone safe, all Miele plants worldwide have obtained certification under the internationally recognised DIN EN ISO 45001 > occupational safety management system. This type of certifi- cation fully replaces the previous OHSAS 18001 framework. The company was recertified in 2020. 4% of the entire workforce is involved in Work Safety Committees. at Miele is directly involved with these commit- tees. These meetings shifted to digital in 2020. In Germany, the Works Constitution Act gov- erns how the works councils of the plants should be involved in matters of workplace health and safety. On the international front, there are corresponding regulations that govern the involvement of employees and their representa- tives. All rules on occupational safety and health also apply to non-Miele employees whose work and/or workplaces are controlled by Miele. The age structure remains a challenge for Miele. At the end of the business years 2019 and 2020, about 46 percent of employees in Germany were 50 years old or above, with the average age as at 31 December 2020 standing at 46.76 years. This means that workstations must be designed to be both age-appropriate and appropriate for ageing workers. To Miele, this means creating suitable pathways for dif- ferent age groups. During this reporting period, the company analysed whether workstations and workflows in production, particularly series production, were ergonomically designed. The results of this analysis were used to revise a number of processes. In assembly, the com- pany worked with employees to develop ideas for an overhaul. In addition, jobs that are espe- cially physically demanding received relief from driverless transport systems and automation. Miele has 24 dedicated specialists employed solely for the purpose of ensuring occupational safety at its plants (in the business year 2020). In addition, the company also has 235 safety officers who perform these tasks alongside their regular company duties. These include pro- viding advice during the planning and realisation of plant systems or when workstations are being designed. The safety officers receive regular con- tinuing education, including quarterly training on various safety topics ranging from haz- ardous substances to noise. Furthermore, regular instruction takes place at all locations. Extensive checklists are available for daily work activities. Regular safety meetings are held at all plants and all departments are frequently inspected. The inspections ensure that the necessary actions are taken conscientiously. Approximately 20 to 25 inspections per year are conducted in G\\u00fctersloh alone. There are also regular continuing educa- tion and training activities to raise all employees\\u2019 awareness of safety in the workplace. Owing to the pandemic, all meetings were held digi- tally in 2020 and inspections were conducted with appropriate safeguards in place. The con- tinuing education and training measures were limited to systematic activities, and specifically those relating to occupational safety and health, which totalled 1,112 in the business year 2020. In addition, the Work Safety Committee at each plant meets four times a year. Approximately four percent of the entire company workforce FOCUS ON COVID-19 PREVENTION [GRI 403-8] The > pandemic made 2020 an exceptionally challenging year in terms of occupational safety and health at Miele. The company needed to maintain business oper- ations while at the same time protecting employees. The measures taken were guided by the SARS-CoV-2 occupational safety stand- ards published by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and further official rules (including the ordinances enacted by the German states to curb the pandemic) and went beyond the legal requirements in some cases. Various interdepartmental and local teams were formed to help fight the virus, map- ping out actions and solutions and taking over responsibility for communication within 73  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES HR management Occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety the company. A dedicated section of the intranet was set up to provide additional information on current developments, help with people\\u2019s day-to-day work and answer many questions from employees. Recom- mended courses of action were provided specifically for management staff on topics such as how to handle suspected cases. WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS Reportable workplace accidents 187 200 2019 2020 Employees with office workstations were asked to work from home for a short time. Those who had to continue working on-site were required to wear face masks as soon as they left their workstations. Beyond that, masks were required for all workstations where social distance of 1.5 meters could not be maintained. In production, employees were divided into shift groups, and break times were staggered to minimise contact. Workplace accidents per one million working hours 2019 2020 9.9 10.5 Hand sanitiser and disinfectant dispensers were installed across the board, and social distancing markings were placed on the floor at all building entrances and exits. The cafe terias were temporarily closed and then reopened with special hygiene and col- lection concepts. Occupancy limits were put in place for offices and meeting rooms to ensure sufficient distance. Wherever minimum distances could not be main- tained, such as in production, partitions were installed. Most meetings were held online rather than in person. Beyond that, the occupational health and safety officers worked with the plant medical service to offer advice on events. Multiple testing sta- tions were set up at the plants, offering Miele employees the chance to be tested for the virus several times a week. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement MINIMISING RISKS OF ACCIDENTS [GRI 403-1/-2/-4/-5] At Miele, the areas of occupational health and safety are regu- lated by the > Miele management system. This ensures a continuous improvement process and helps with the continual anal- ysis of accident data, for example. company, from the initial report to the plant medical service through to archiving in the acci- dent database. In the course of these activities, supervisors, occupational safety special- ists, safety officers, company medical officers, and works council members were all asked to update risk assessments and define imme- diate actions to take in case of emergency. Since Miele is a production company with a high level of vertical integration, some of the jobs carry health risks or are particu- larly hazardous, such as those involved in the surface treatment of materials and in metal- working. Numerous measures are taken to eliminate or mitigate risks, from risk assess- ments of workstations and psychological strain, some of which are required by law, to protective clothing and training activ- ities aimed at preventing accidents. Training, posted notices and app notifica- tions advise employees when there is any change in the required protective measures. In addition, employees can report any dan- gers directly to their supervisor during daily team meetings. External companies and their employees who enter Miele grounds receive timely information from Miele about the occu- pational safety requirements that apply there. FIRST AID IN EMERGENCIES AND ACUTE CASES [GRI 403-3] A plant medical service has been in place since 1973 in G\\u00fctersloh. Along with the legal duties which result from the Occupational Safety Act, the plant med- ical service also takes care of first aid in the event of emergencies and acute illnesses. They work together with the Miele com- pany insurance provider BKK to provide and actively promote the annual influenza vaccination. At all other sites, insurance-ac- credited physicians and medical personnel ensure that employees receive proper care. The same is also true of workers who are not employees, but who work or have a workstation at Miele, albeit only tempo- rarily. These are mainly temporary employees and employees of service companies. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT The number of workplace accidents per million hours worked stood at 9.9 in the busi- ness year 2020 (2019: 10.6), below the industry average of 15.2 (2019) reported by German professional associations. In this reporting period, Miele fully digitalised the handling of accidents across the entire [GRI 403-6] Miele relies on occupational health management at its German sites to systematically manage all health-related oper- ational processes.

Vein screening was offered for over 700 employees in G\\u00fctersloh and Euskirchen in 2019 and early 2020, with an excellent response. The other sites also held Health Day events focusing on topics such as healthy eating, coping with stress, protecting one\\u2019s skin, restful sleep and cardiovascular disease. Over 6,400 people participated in these occupa- tional health management activities across all German sites in 2019. All events and courses were initially cancelled at the start of the pandemic, in 2020, but they were then gradually brought back in online for- mats. This was the reason for the significant decrease in the total number of participants. Closely linked with Miele\\u2019s occupational health management activities, the company also engages in occupational integration management at all German sites (plants and sales and service centres). It is intended to make it easier for employees who have suffered from lengthy periods of illness to return to their jobs. 900 managers have participated in qualification seminars on the topic of \\u201cHealthy Management\\u201d. of them support employees in relation to var- ious health-related topics, like healthy eating and coping with depression and addiction.

Over 900 managers \\u2013 the vast majority \\u2013 have participated since the seminars were first offered, in 2015. At the Bielefeld, G\\u00fctersloh and Oelde sites, managers who work in production receive additional training on how to wel- come new employees in a spirit of respect and appreciation. Miele also ensures that managers develop an eye for proper ergo- nomic working. In this way, they can help employees work more ergonomi- cally, including with help from the health management team where needed. LIFE COACHING AND ADDICTION COUNSELLING [GRI 404-2] Miele began offering employees at the German plants the option to seek life coaching and addiction counselling in early 2014. Trained contact persons are available to provide assistance. In addition, a 24-hour counselling hotline is also available through a service provider to handle crisis situa- tions. The two counsellors in G\\u00fctersloh alone logged some 400 consultations from mid-2019 to mid-2020. Frequent topics include work- place incidents, psychological strain and family issues. Beyond the counselling itself, smoking cessation programmes have also been offered. SPECIAL PROGRAMMES FOR APPRENTICES AND TRAINEES Promoting health is also an integral fea- ture of vocational training activities at Miele. All apprentices and trainees participate in five required events as part of the health insur- ance programme \\u201cAzubi fit\\u201d. These include an introduction to occupational health and a seminar on maintaining a healthy back. During this reporting period, the programme was also expanded to include identifying and coping with stress or addiction. All pro- gramme activities moved online in 2020. Technical apprentices also attend training ses- sions offered by professional associations.

A wide range of hands-on opportunities for technical apprentices have been created at the sales subsidi- aries in Ireland and Italy and at the plant in B\\u00fcrmoos, Austria. In all, eleven appren- tices and trainees, eleven students enrolled in dual programmes, and two interns spent time abroad during the reporting period. AWARDS FOR GRADUATES AND NEW PATHS TO VOCATIONAL TRAINING not only an electrical systems installer voca- tional training track, but also a business traineeship toward certification as a manage- ment assistant in industry. The quality of Miele\\u2019s programmes for young professionals was confirmed in 2020 by the Clevis corporate consultancy. Miele was ranked second in a study of the best German employers for young professionals and named \\u201cRising Star of the Year\\u201d (Aufsteiger des Jahres) for its dramatically improved ranking. When training its young professionals, Miele is careful to ensure that they develop digital skills and then apply them at the company. During this reporting period, for example, two new dual programmes with a focus on digital aspects were introduced. The \\u201cDigital Technologies\\u201d programme gives partici- pants extensive professional knowledge and skills relating to advanced informa- tion and communication technologies and fundamental knowledge of engineering. The \\u201cDigital Business Management\\u201d pro- gramme offers a broad-based education in business administration, expanding on the fundamentals of traditional business administration and adding solid IT-related basics. Three students started in these dual programmes in September 2020. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR APPRENTICES AND STUDENTS Gathering international experience is playing an ever greater role in training at Miele, which is why more assignments abroad will 459 apprentices and trainees in Germany at the start of vocational training in September 2020 The high quality of training at Miele is regularly confirmed externally. In the business years 2019 and 2020, a total of 33 apprentices in Germany passed their final exams with flying colours, earning the best possible marks. Nine of them were also named \\u201cbest in chamber\\u201d (Kammerbeste) by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. As part of the \\u201cCollective Labour Agreement for the Promotion of Apprenticeship Profi- ciency\\u201d (Tarifvertrag zur F\\u00f6rderung der Ausbildungsf\\u00e4higkeit), Miele offers internships to disadvantaged young people and those with lower academic performance. The objective is to open up a path for them into vocational training. Since 2009, this pro- gramme has successfully helped prepare 22 young people for an apprenticeship at Miele. In the business year 2019, two young men successfully completed the programme. Both began training to become industrial mechanics in September 2019. In 2020, two young men also started their training after successfully completing their internships. This was the first year that candidates were offered DUAL STUDY PROGRAMMES AT MIELE Since 1995, Miele has been offering school graduates the opportunity to complete var- ious commercial and technical dual study programmes in fields such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or busi- ness informatics. During the reporting period, 54 graduates successfully completed their dual study programmes, with over 80 per- cent of them going on to be hired by Miele. PROGRAMMES FOR UNIVERSITY GRADUATES Miele offers attractive entry-level opportunities for specialists and managers with an aca- demic background. Along with direct entry, there are two further entry-level programmes for graduates with bachelor\\u2019s degrees: The Master@Miele programme is a part-time master\\u2019s degree programme, usually with a technical focus. The Junior Sales Represent- ative Programme for entry into sales is also open to recruits who have not followed a tra- ditional career path. The programme gives talented candidates from other industries or 77  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement disciplines the opportunity to become junior sales representatives within just one year. INTERNSHIPS, SCHOLARSHIPS AND UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS During the reporting period, Miele offered more than 250 internships and thesis super- vision positions each year. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company was able to continue to offer internships and coop- erative relationships focusing on thesis projects. Most internships were con- ducted both on-site and through remote work on an alternating basis, with pro- fessional supervision at all times. Miele stays in close contact with selected technical and business-oriented universities around the world with the aim of contacting future applicants at an early stage and in a targeted manner. For example, the com- pany assigns practical projects to students, organises application and assessment centre training and offers excursions. In the reporting period, Miele was represented once more at numerous trade fairs for stu- dents, graduates and young professionals. In 2020, Miele shifted its participation in recruiting fairs to a different model. After a several-month phase when all fairs were cancelled by organisers and participating companies due to the pandemic, a shift toward digital formats began to take shape around the middle of the year. Miele partic- ipated in smaller events in this space, with up to 50 attendees. These new dialogue for- mats proved to be a good way to open up direct lines of communication with low bar- riers to entry, and Miele was able to recruit young professionals through these avenues. In its home region of eastern Westphalia, Miele offers ten scholarships a year to espe- cially talented candidates as part of the Deutschlandstipendium programme, com- bining them with social engagement and measures to support talented candidates. The Chinese plant in Dongguan awards four scholarships every year to students from the Dongguan Technology College who stand out as a result of their out- standing performance. Priority is given to students from less privileged back- grounds who perform at the same level. WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FOR TRAINING AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT [GRI 404-1/-2] A variety of training pro- grammes make a pivotal contribution to continuing to ensure the company\\u2019s suc- cess in the future. The responsibility for these programmes lies with the training divi- sion. Miele is involved in various different initiatives to get prospective young pro- fessionals interested in the company at an early stage. For example, the company participates in Girls\\u2019 Day. Its interna- tional trainee programme is one way Miele is putting its global focus into practice. HR development at Miele has an interna- tional focus. Succession management, for example, follows a uniform, IT-supported pro- cess throughout the company, which allows an overall view of all management posi- tions and makes it possible to come up with the best succession solutions for cer- tain people or positions early on. Part-time further training is of particular strategic sig- nificance to the company. To hold our own and continue to innovate, we need to pro- vide targeted support for employees to reach their full potential. Key development pro- grammes for talented professionals and to provide training for managers are increas- ingly being expanded internationally. In the process, Miele does not focus solely on specific on-the-job requirements, but also takes employees\\u2019 individual skills and aptitudes into account. Measures to sup- port employees\\u2019 growth and development at Miele include the following in particular: Systematic further training and advancement of skilled personnel and managers from within the company Continuous development and expansion of an international talent management process Goal-oriented HR development measures for specific target groups Ensuring internal knowledge management and employee networking Standardisation of learning processes across all locations Further development at Miele is a standardised process and is supported by a learning man- agement system (LMS) software solution that is 8.9 hours were spent by Miele employees on development on average in 2020. increasingly being used internationally as well. Opportunities for further training are planned and documented via the LMS, giving managers an overview of the progress that employees are making with their further development. Learning plans document the qualification measures planned for employees as well as the ones they have already completed. In addition, Miele intro- duced an online evaluation of further training measures in the 2019\\u20132020 period. Participants reported average satisfaction levels with their training measures of more than 5.2 on a scale from 1 to 6, with 6 being the highest possible rating. Ninety-five percent of respondents would recommend Miele\\u2019s training measures to others. The \\u201cMiele Change Agent\\u201d is one element of the LMS. This digital training format is part of the extensive worldwide learning and sup- port options offered in the Design2Excellence programme, preparing employees for the > transformation of Miele that is associated with the programme.

DIGITAL LEARNING Miele made further strides in adopting dig- ital learning technologies in 2020. Working in tandem with external training institutions, the company shifted almost all areas of its training activities to digital learning formats. This allowed Miele to meet employees\\u2019 edu- cation needs even without holding in-person events. Things like LinkedIn Learning were helpful here. This extensive digital learning platform offered by professional social network LinkedIn has been available to Miele employees since January 2020. The \\u201cDigital Fitness\\u201d training initiative was also launched in 2020. Its goal is to raise awareness of the digital transformation among all employees and boost digital skills at the company. Plans call for the programme to be expanded further in the years to come. TEACHING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS \\u2013 AND ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE [GRI 404-2] Within the scope of its internal further training programmes, Miele pro- vides qualification opportunities for various fields such as management, project and change management, or IT applications. Miele bases various overarching, central qualification topics and specific qualification measures on its Miele competency model, which describes the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to be successful at the company. Through job descrip- tions, the model provides career planning assistance, for example. Miele also offers employees the opportunity to advance their management skills internationally. A very broad range of options are offered for advancing technical and professional skills. Miele uses a certified project man- agement training programme from the International Project Management Associ- ation (IPMA). The company introduced the programme in product development back in 2010, to great success, and has now been expanding it to other areas of the company. Certified project managers can manage complex projects with excellent structure and organisation and have a shared under- standing of how projects are executed at the Group level. The crucial factor is that many projects are growing increasingly com- plex, even those outside traditional product development. Miele now has more than 200 employees trained as project managers. In addition, employees in Germany have the opportunity to further their education by attending external training events in their areas of expertise. Miele also expressly supports any employees who wish to take part in part-time further training on their own initiative. The company provides finan- cial support for accredited, part-time further training courses or degree pro- grammes. Forty-four employees made use of this option during the reporting period. 79  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Miele also relies on experienced employees to share their knowledge and expertise. As part of the Miele Mentoring Programme, experienced employees are matched with junior managers and specialists to pro- vide them with career guidance by offering advice, establishing contacts, assisting with project development and giving feedback. WIDE RANGE OF OPEN TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES [GRI 404-2] Open training remains an impor- tant supplementary part of the training and education opportunities offered at Miele. These options are geared towards all employees in Germany. Unlike the internal and external training options, these open training sessions are held during employees\\u2019 free time. Miele covers the cost of these sessions. In the business year 2019, exactly 2,691 employees took part. That number stood at just 1,086 in 2020. The decrease was because almost all of the planned sessions had to be cancelled in the spring of 2020 due to the pandemic. The sessions were shifted to digital learning formats for the autumn programme \\u2013 and participation figures rebounded. The pro- gramme saw a considerable shift during the reporting period, going from in-person sessions to mainly digital formats. COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATION Filling at least three out of four open man- agerial positions from within the company is one of Miele\\u2019s stated goals. Particular attention is therefore paid to promoting the development of managers. Employees who take on a managerial position for the first time are prepared extensively for their new role with the help of a binding qualifi- cation programme. Further opportunities for learning and gaining experience that focus on transferring practical experience and feedback are available to experienced managers. One new feature introduced in 2020 was the \\u201cVirtual Management\\u201d (\\u201cVir- tuell f\\u00fchren\\u201d) live online training series, which is offered for managers working from home. Agile management was another new topic introduced in 2020, debuting in the smart home segment. Twenty-six man- agers in that area spent approximately six months training for their new leadership role in the context of the agile transformation. The Miele Business Academy plays a key role in the company\\u2019s efforts to train and educate its managerial staff. Seminars are held in English, and participants come from all cor- ners of the Miele world. The Miele Business Academy now offers 19 different training and learning options for international man- agers with various levels of experience, covering key management topics and skills. The one hundredth participant successfully completed the \\u201cManagement & Leadership Compact\\u201d course in 2019. Fifty participants attended the six events held in this course in the calendar years 2019 and 2020 alone (equivalent to 494 days of participation). DIGITALISATION UNLOCKS ADVANCED FORMS OF TRAINING AND LEARNING All new apprentices and trainees have been equipped with mobile devices since September 2020. This allows them to use digital learning platforms and similar options on their own. The MLS (\\u201cMobile Learning in Smart Factories\\u201d) dig- ital learning platform was introduced for vocational training activities back in 2019. Apprentices can access specially prepared, company-specific learning content, allowing them to learn anytime, anywhere. This further enhances the quality of the training and education they receive. Thanks to these measures, Miele was able to continue to ensure the same solid, challenging types of vocational training in 2020, even amid the pandemic.

Citizens of Turkey, Greece, Italy and Poland accounted for the largest share. Employees with disabilities made up 6 percent of all Miele workers in Germany (in the business years 2019 and 2020).

This time around, they presented their insights into diversity through a creative digital photo collage. used by women via the > \\u201cCrossMentoring OWL\\u201d network. There are also regular dialogue and networking formats, such as \\u201cWomen with Power of Attorney\\u201d (\\u201cFrauen in Vollmacht\\u201d) for people with these authorisations and additional specific groups like meetings of female engi- neers. As at the end of December 2019, women accounted for 22.3 percent of the German workforce. The figure for the year after that was 22.1 percent. Worldwide, women made up 29.7 percent of the staff at Miele as at 31 December 2020. accommodate this with its family-friendly working conditions. In November 2020, Miele launched a strategic project in Greece to fill more entry-level and managerial positions with women. Female workers accounted for 41 percent of the staff in Greece in 2020. [GRI 405-1] Miele aims to raise awareness throughout the company of the vast poten- tial lying in diverse life and work experiences, perspectives and values. The company phi- losophy, the Miele Code of Conduct and the company-wide agreement on the German General Equal Treatment Act form the Group-wide framework for cultivating diver- sity and equal opportunity and taking action against discrimination. The company has demonstrated its adherence to this idea towards external and internal audiences alike by obtaining > SA8000 certification and signing the Diversity Charter in 2012. In the business year 2020, 6.3 percent (2019: 6.0 percent) of Miele employees in Germany were citizens of a country other COMMITMENT TO FEMALE EMPLOYEES Furthering female talent is firmly rooted as a point of Miele\\u2019s corporate strategy in its own right. In keeping with this position, it is also a particular area of focus for the company\\u2019s diversity measures. Miele supports women\\u2019s careers through various concepts. Just like their male colleagues, every woman at Miele who is identified and designated as being especially talented receives a full spectrum of individual growth and development opportuni- ties. Alongside the internal mentoring programme, which matches talented individ- uals with an experienced Miele manager or specialist, those with high potential can also access external mentoring, which is primarily Increasing the number of women in manage- ment positions is a stated goal of the HR policy, both in Germany and internationally. A total of 11.3 percent of managerial positions in Germany and 24.4 percent of managerial positions worldwide were held by women at the end of 2020. Miele does not consider it appropriate to define a fixed quota for increasing the proportion of women in mana- gerial positions. Miele instead strives to recruit the most qualified candidate for each position that must be filled, regardless of gender. Female candidates displaying high potential are specifically supported and encouraged to set ambitious professional goals, as well as to keep pursuing these goals after having chil- dren, if they choose to do so.

In dual study programmes in Germany, women accounted for 21.3 percent that same year in technical fields and 41.7 percent in business fields. Supporting female employees plays a central role at Miele. 29.7% was the worldwide percentage of women in the overall Miele workforce in 2020. (As at 31 December 2020) New managers are trained individually, com- pleting a one-day training programme titled \\u201cLeading through Diversity\\u201d (\\u201cDiversity \\u2013 Vielfalt f\\u00fchren\\u201d). The goal of this programme is to spur efforts towards greater diversity in managers\\u2019 own teams and to tap into the potential that this diversity offers. NO DIFFERENCES IN THE SALARIES RECEIVED BY WOMEN AND MEN [GRI 405-2] Remuneration at Miele\\u2019s German sites takes place according to a person\\u2019s job and in keeping with collective agreements based on the framework pay agreement for the metal and electronics industry. Therefore, there are no differences in the remunera- tion of women and men at Miele. Merit pay is categorised and calculated strictly based on the specific task and actual performance and does not take unrelated criteria into account. Measures to ensure that employee pay does not differ based on gender or other diversity criteria are also in place at the com- pany\\u2019s international production sites. In the reporting period, Miele once again participated in the \\u201cWomen\\u2019s Career Index\\u201d project, which is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. Each year, the initiative highlights companies that take targeted action to provide fair career opportu- nities to women. The company is also committed to promoting female junior professionals, apprentices and trainees. In 2020, women made up 9.7 percent of those enrolled in technical vocational training and 60.2 percent of commercial apprentice- 12.2% women in technical apprenticeships; 57.4% women in commercial apprenticeships in Germany in September 2020 in relation to vocational training and the dual study programmes as a whole. CONTENTS 82  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Social engagement Promoting regional appeal [GRI 413-1/-2] As one of the largest employers in the area, Miele is traditionally closely asso- ciated with G\\u00fctersloh and Ostwestfalen-Lippe \\u2013 the region which it calls home. Right back to the company\\u2019s founders, Miele has always been aware of its responsibility for the well- being of employees and their families. A wide-ranging social engagement initiative has developed over the decades as a result of this care. Activities are largely focused on the regions surrounding the company sites. In this way, Miele helps to maintain a smooth-running, attractive environment. social engagement that apply to the sales sub- sidiaries chart the fundamental course for this. For example, the only donations permitted are to non-profit or charitable organisations. The responsible parties at the sales subsidiaries identify suitable projects themselves. Miele is in close communication with local communi- ties at all its locations and therefore has a good understanding of their needs. Miele wishes to be a reliable partner for the local authorities, associations and initiatives. With this in mind, it aims to support projects on a long-term basis, wherever possible. In special cases, this engagement, which is focused on continuity, is supplemented by flexible, short-term support. \\u20ac 175,000 \\u20ac were used for donations in 2020. In 2019, the Miele Foundation took part in social projects and initiatives amounting to around 97,000 euros. In 2020, the donation volume was much lower, at 50,000 euros, since many events were can- celled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. SUPPORTING FAMILIES Supporting and improving the oppor- tunities of young people from the areas surrounding the Miele sites has always been a key aspect of Miele\\u2019s social engagement. ENGAGEMENT BY THE COMPANY AND THE MIELE FOUNDATION Miele\\u2019s social activities are aimed at sup- porting youth and families and at education and culture. This applies not only to Miele as a company, but also to the foundation of the same name, which was established in 1974. While the explicit development goal of the Miele Foundation\\u2019s charter is the pro- motion of public welfare in the German city of G\\u00fctersloh, the company itself addresses a broader range of needs and also pursues active social engagement at other plant sites. The international sales subsidiaries also engage in diverse initiatives. The guidelines on FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABILITY Miele takes a very broad view of sustainability, in line with the 17 Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations. The international sales subsidi- aries also engage in extremely diverse and sustainable initiatives. For example, Miele partnered with three artists in Switzerland in 2020 to stand against disposable \\u201cfast fashion\\u201d. The campaign, dubbed \\u201cSame Shirt Different\\u201d, invited participants to upcycle existing articles of clothing, cushions or bags with iron-on patches using the Fashion- Master steam ironing system from Miele. DONATIONS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD [GRI 201-1, 415-1] Traditionally, Miele supports a number of regional charities with an annual donation of money or items. The projects to be supported are decided upon by the respon- sible division depending on the urgency and requirements of the requests. Large donations need to be approved by the Executive Board. In the business year 2018/19, Miele & Cie. KG donated a total of 175,000 euros in Germany. In the business year 2020, which now matches the calendar year, approximately 175,000 euros in funding was used for dona- tion purposes again. Since 1976, the Miele Foundation has offered significant financial support to the G\\u00fcter- sloh Holiday Games for children between the ages of 5 and 17. Every year, this oppor- tunity includes many different and various activities that provide care during school holidays. Support for the project \\u201cJugend- integration durch Sport\\u201d (integrating young people through sport) is also provided through an annual donation. This pro- ject was launched by the department for children and youth development in the city of G\\u00fctersloh in 2009. It aims to pro- mote social skills in young people that are rarely gained from usual sporting activity. Activities include hip-hop courses for girls or mixed indoor football, for example. 83  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Since 2014, the company has supported the G\\u00fctersloh Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children with its \\u201cHand in Hand\\u201d family mentors project. In this project, volun- tary female family mentors visit families for a few hours each week to support the chil- dren and parents in difficult times. In 2019, 24 families received support from 24 men- tors in all. The figure for 2020 was 22 families. DIGITALISATION AND SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION STRENGTHENING CULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES Diverse cultural opportunities contribute sig- nificantly to making a region attractive and increasing the local quality of life. Therefore, an important element of Miele\\u2019s engagement has traditionally been to promote culture. In this reporting period, the company once again supported the Westf\\u00e4lische Kammerphil- harmonie ensemble, which is composed of members of well-known German orchestras, independent musicians and especially qualified students, an approach that stands out from the rest of the German orchestra landscape. To comply with its regional responsibili- ties, Miele also supports the digital transition through initiatives such as the \\u201cDigitale Agenda G\\u00fctersloh\\u201d and its first digitalisa- tion strategy. This project is among the \\u201cSmart Cities Made in Germany\\u201d model pro- jects. As part of the initiative, the German federal government provides about 8.5 million euros in funding to support for- ward-looking projects in G\\u00fctersloh, out of a total volume of about 13 million euros. Like in previous years, Miele supported Kulturgemeinschaft Dreiecksplatz, an associ- ation that organises various cultural events in G\\u00fctersloh, in both 2019 and 2020. In August 2020, an event called \\u201cKlangwandel\\u201d was launched as a partnership between Kultur- gemeinschaft Dreiecksplatz and three other organisers. In the project, sound collages were created in public spaces by art- ists who would normally have appeared on an open-air stage in G\\u00fctersloh this year. A significant objective of Miele\\u2019s involvement in education is to inspire children and young people to get involved in technology and to introduce young adults to technical profes- sional fields. In the reporting period, Miele supported non-profit association \\u201cDas erste Buch e.V.\\u201d, which aims to foster and sup- port a culture of reading among children and teens while cultivating their creativity and self-confidence. Schoolchildren in G\\u00fcters loh wrote exciting stories as part of the pro- ject. A panel of judges selected the top entries, which were published in a collected volume with financial support from Miele. DONATIONS TO EASE THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE In response to the devastating wildfires in January 2020, employees of the sales subsidiary in Australia col- lected donations for a number of aims: to care for wildlife, restore destroyed habitats, and promote ecot- ourism in the affected areas. Many employees used social media to highlight the campaign for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia (WWF-Australia), which col- lected funds equivalent to nearly 34,000 euros in all.

Over half of the total amount was invested in product development and in the expansion, conversion and modernisation of the international Miele Group production network. Miele also opened new flagship stores (Miele Experience Centers) at its sites in Sydney, Brussels and Sao Paolo, among others.

In G\\u00fctersloh, use of a stainless steel welding system also started, enhancing the level of vertical integration and leading to the creation of more stainless steel scrap. Lehrte saw investments in infrastructure, resulting in significant quantities of waste from excavated soil. In Uni\\u010dov, the ramp-up of a wash cabinet production process for dishwashers also led to an increase in metal scrap, which had a marked effect on the amount of waste. 1) The waste disposal method was determined on the basis of information provided by the waste disposal provider.

The volume of solid waste for disposal rose relatively sharply in the reporting period due to an increase in production activity, as well as extracted soil for a new supply duct at the Lehrte plant and chrome steel waste from the commissioning of a new welding system in G\\u00fctersloh. Though the addition of the new system does create more waste, it is also accompanied by an enhanced level of vertical integration. This allows Miele to exert more influence on the quality of the corresponding components.

Moreover, the new plant in Poland was taken into account in the recording of data for the first time in 2020. Another reason for the increased water consumption is the dry summer and the necessary watering of green spaces as a result. 1) Water consumption is measured using water meters and taken from the energy reports from the energy management system. 2) Rainwater which is stored in cisterns or other similar containers and fed into a separate water system.

According to the location-based method, the values for the business year 2019 stood at 132,018 tonnes of CO2-equivalent and 128,646 tonnes of CO2-equivalent for 2020. The emission factors for 2019 from the German PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) were used to perform calculations in line with the location-based method. Alternatively, emission factors from the British Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) were also used. Total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions fell by 40 percent year on year in 2020. The decline in direct emissions (Scope 1) stood at 8 percent due to reduced natural gas and heating oil consumption, as well as the Covid-19-related reduction in mileage and the associated CO2 emissions of the company\\u2019s own vehicles. At 65 percent, the reduction in indirect emissions (Scope 2) was significantly higher, primarily as a result of the switch to green electricity. In 2020, 86 percent of the Miele locations worldwide covered their electricity needs with renewable energy. Moreover, electricity and district heat consumption fell further year on year across the Group. 1) The scope was expanded in 2019 to cover all production sites and sales subsidiaries, as well as the participations Steelco and Yujin. 2) Deviations of the total of the individual amounts from the entire figure in question are attributable to rounding. 3) Presentation of greenhouse gas emissions expanded from CO2 to CO2-equivalent, with CH4 and N20 being taken into account in addition to CO2 Emissions from volatile gases were considered irrelevant following a materiality analysis. 4) The calculation method used for the fleet was switched from the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to real consumption, with an uncertainty factor of 10 percent included for locations not previously taken into account.

For certain processes and methods (including generating own power in combined heat and power units), Miele applies for full tax relief on power and energy. This is based on the period of purchase/ consumption. The company received tax relief of 416,000 euros in the calendar year 2019. Tax relief in the calendar year 2020 amounted to 952,000 euros. 109109  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Key figures GRI content index GRI content index GRI standards and information Links GRI 202: MARKET PRESENCE 2016 103- 1/2/3 Management approach Employees & society > HR management 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage Employees & society > HR management > Fair pay \\u2013 naturally As a member of metal and electronics industry associations, Miele is obliged to pay the wages specified in collective wage agreements. In Germany, 90 percent of the workforce at Miele plants and at the Miele central office is covered by such agreements. The remaining 10 percent of the workforce is paid outside of the scope of collective wage agreements, meaning they receive higher pay. The German plants employ 11,066 people and are therefore classed as important.

The quantities withdrawn from own wells have been halved in recent decades. There were no abnormalities in water samples in the reporting period. Quality is not affected by the withdrawal of water. 303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts Supply chain & production > Resource efficiency > Waste water: regular measurements At all Miele plants, with the exception of Bra\\u015fov, there are at least two waste water systems \\u2013 one for dirty water, and one for rain water. The latter is channelled to dry wells. Dirty water is treated in municipal waste water processing facilities in accordance with municipal requirements. The same applies to technical waste water from surface treatment facilities at the G\\u00fctersloh, Oelde and Lehrte plants. In-house monitoring measures have been agreed for technical waste water. No detailed breakdown by discharge location, water quality and reuse of water by other organisations is provided. 303-3 Water withdrawal Key figures > Supply chain & production > Resource efficiency Miele is keen to focus on water shortage and water-stressed areas and intends to report on these issues in the future.

CONTENTS 119119  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES About this report Miele has been publishing sustainability reports since 2002. This report, the tenth of its kind, documents the compa- ny\\u2019s progress in line with the Miele sustainability strategy and the guiding principle \\u201cForever Better\\u201d. The objective of the 2021 report is to make the performance of the company in sustainability-related matters transparent to stakeholders such as sustainability experts, customers, employees and business partners. The content reflects the main sustaina- bility issues affecting the company. These issues were most recently identified in 2018 in the course of a materiality anal- ysis and were weighted according to their relevance for Miele. [GRI 102-54] Miele\\u2019s reporting on sustainability is geared towards the internationally recognised standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This report was prepared in accordance with the Core option of the GRI standards. To meet stakeholders\\u2019 needs for information optimally, the report also includes additional information. Refer- ences to the individual GRI indicators are associated with the key figures and the relevant passages in the text. The GRI content index is found at the end of this report. The structure of this report follows that of the preceding report, which was issued in 2019. Its four main chapters \\u2013 Management & processes, Products & services, Supply chain & production and Employees & society \\u2013 also reflect the fields of action and focal points of the Miele sustainability strategy, which was further refined during this reporting period. This makes it easier to see how the measures described in the subchapters contribute to meeting the strategic targets. PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION [GRI 102-45/-50] Unlike the previous report, the Sustainability Report 2021 relates not to the last two business years at Miele (each of which ended on 30 June), but rather to the preceding calendar years. This is because the Miele busi- ness year was shifted to the calendar year in 2020. As a result, the reporting period runs from 1 January 2019 until 31 December 2020. Beyond that, key content from the second half of 2018 was also taken into account. The edito- rial deadline was in September 2021. Relevant occurrences noted by then were included in the report. Unless other- wise stated, all information, including key figures, refers to Miele & Cie. KG and its subsidiary Imperial-Werke oHG. This includes all German production and administrative sites, as well as sales and service in Germany. It also encom- passes \\u2013 under the umbrella of Miele Beteiligungs-GmbH \\u2013 the production sites in Bra\\u015fov (Romania), B\\u00fcrmoos (Austria), Dongguan (China), Ksawer\\u00f3w (Poland) and Uni\\u010dov (Czech Republic), along with the international sales subsidiaries. [GRI 102-10/-48/-49] During the reporting period, there were significant changes in relation to the size and > structure of the Group. A second washing machine plant com- menced operations in Ksawer\\u00f3w at the end of 2019, for example. The relocation of part of production operations from the B\\u00fcrmoos plant (manufacturing of medical products) to Steelco S.p.A., a subsidiary in Italy, was also concluded in 2019. In addition, the subsidiary Miele Venture Cap- ital GmbH acquired stakes in the following companies or increased its existing stakes in these companies during the reporting period: Agrilution Systems GmbH, MChef EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Verwaltungs-GmbH and MChef GmbH & Co. KG, Miele Operations & Payment Solutions GmbH, WaschMal GmbH, KptnCook Corp., Plant Jammer ApS and loadbee GmbH. Miele Venture Capital GmbH and its subsidiaries and sharehold- ings, as well as Steelco S.p.A. and Yujin Robot Co., Ltd, are not yet fully reflected in this report except where noted sep- arately, such as in > the company profile and > key figures. The Miele Sustainability Report is available > online as a PDF file. A detailed listing of key figures appears in the \\u201cFacts & figures\\u201d section at the end of the report. The sustainability website also offers customers and the public at large an overview of the Miele sustainability philosophy and how it is put into practice. It is available at > www.miele.com/sustainability and via Miele.de or Miele.com. The use of the full legal forms throughout the text has been avoided for the sake of greater readability. As in the pre- vious report, we use gender-specific designations, except in lists and where linguistic usage dictates otherwise.

SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 121 \",\n          \"General information . Describe your business model (including business object, products/services) . For more than 30 years, the CVH Group, with its locations throughout Germany in Hanover, Hamburg, Berlin and Magdeburg, has been committed to providing fast, reliable supplies of basic and specialty chemicals. In addition, the focus is on application engineering consulting and the acquisition of usable residual materials. Two key criteria of our philosophy are to place people at the centre of our actions and sustainably deal with resources. Therefore, we participate in the Responsible Care Programme and have an energy management system. Economic decisions are made with regard to sustainability. Within this framework, each of our 120 employees is also committed to environmentally conscious action. In the 2018 financial year, an annual turnover of EUR 75 million was achieved.\\\"The success of our customers is our success and sustainability is a common success factor.\\\" . Additional remarks: . Energy Management 50001 The CVH Group has implemented an energy management system throughout the company and has successfully been certified in accordance with ISO 50001:2011. Responsible Care Responsible Care is a worldwide program for the safe handling of chemicals. The entire CVH Group has been participating in the Responsible Care program of the Chemical Trade Association for more than 20 years. ISO 9001:2015 The ongoing work on our certified QM system naturally also includes the constant adaptation to the current state of the standard, whether it be to the process-oriented revision in 2008 or to the upcoming risk-based version DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 (already carried out, current data available) ESAD II (European Single Assessment Document) This is a standardized catalogue of questions developed from the Resposible Care program. The catalogue of questions covers the topics of safety, health, environmental protection and quality. . 1. Strategic analysis and measures . The company discloses whether it pursues a sustainability strategy and explains what concrete measures it is taking to operate in accordance with the essential and recognised industry-specific, national and international standards. . Our initiative for sustainability covers the areas of social responsibility, environmental protection, health and product safety. From this we are currently developing a sustainability strategy. The goal of the CVH Group is to be the most sustainable chemical distributor in Germany. Social responsibility Compliance with the social standards is a matter of course and mandatory for all employees. CVH is committed to the preservation of ethics and morals. This includes compliance with statutory regulations and prohibitions as well as compliance with self-imposed codes of conduct (compliance) and competition law. But also a targeted development of employees and the creation of an optimal working environment are an essential part of our social responsibility. In addition, the CVH Group promotes projects for child care and youth care at home and abroad. Environmental protection Through conversions to more efficient products at our customers and the use of modern measuring and dosing technology, the use of chemicals can be significantly reduced. The associated saving of resources is another important contribution to protecting our environment. Health By switching to more efficient products and training our customers' staff in handling hazardous substances, we not only want to reduce the environmental impact as much as possible, but also to reduce potential sources of danger for individual employees when handling chemicals. Our modern fleet of vehicles also contributes to the safe transport of dangerous substances and the likelihood of an accident to a minimum. Product safety The safe handling of hazardous substances has always been an important concern of CVH and is constantly being pursued by the exchange of problematic hazardous substances with customers and the use of intelligent packaging solutions. This not only leads to a safe handling of chemicals, but can also lead to a higher security of supply in certain areas of application. In this way, legal requirements or limited capacities of producers are taken into account. . 2. Materiality . The company discloses which aspects of its own business activities have a significant impact on aspects of sustainability and the significant impact the aspects of sustainability have on its business activities. It analyses the positive and negative effects and indicates how these findings are incorporated into its own processes. . The concept of sustainability is firmly anchored in our company policy. Participation in the Responsible Care Programme of the German Chemical Trade Association (VCH) documents our self-contribution to a responsible handling of chemicals towards customers, suppliers, authorities and our fellow citizens, oriented towards safety and environmental protection. In the chemical trade there are not only opportunities that arise from our sustainability idea, but also risks in which one becomes more expensive by sustainable solutions to competitors to lose. Nevertheless, many possibilities arise from sustainable activities. Customers who are subject to the CSR reporting obligation of the EU can be bound to the company more closely. In addition, one can not gain sustainability from sustainability, e.g. customers their previous suppliers. Therefore, for us the opportunities that result from the sustainability aspect in relation to our business activities prevail. The following topics have influence on our business activities: logistics, product optimization, services and water treatment. Logistics In the area of logistics, we attach importance to environmentally friendly packaging solutions which can achieve packaging savings. This is realized by our deposit system. In addition, we are continuously working on a fleet optimization. Product optimization Product optimization includes, for example, the exchange of problematic hazardous materials by less dangerous products, an application-technical consulting regarding the use of chemicals, product training as well as the planning and installation of the ideal extraction technology for chemicals.ServicesWe support our customers in the proper utilization of the residual materials with the help of approved disposal partners and advise on all problems from the field of disposal. In addition, we take back contaminated solvents for recycling within the framework of the circular management law.Water treatmentThe focus of water treatment is on saving fresh water by treating waste and cooling water and using modern measuring, dosing and control technology. . Product management; employee training/further training; customer loyalty; data protection/data security; behaviour compliant with law and guidelines; revenue management; stakeholder dialogue; responsible management of resources . Objectives . The company discloses which qualitative and/or quantitative as well as time-defined sustainability goals are set and operationalized and how their level of achievement is controlled. . The CVH Group is committed to implementing a sustainability initiative in sales and procurement. This means in concrete terms that an 8% reduction in energy consumption between 2016 and 2020 (each year 2%) is to be achieved. In addition, the energy management system DIN:ISO 50001 aims to determine savings potentials, whose implementation and costs are to be examined and, if necessary, implemented. Our fleet is up to date. We only use new generation trucks with Euro 6 engines. Reducing fleet consumption and emissions is an important point in terms of our sustainability goals. All trucks have installed the so-called Fleetboard system from Mercedes. This system is used for efficient tour planning and also enables an operational analysis. Based on this application analysis, the driving behaviour can be evaluated monthly. The system awards grades of 1-10 and evaluates, among other things, predictive driving, wear and fuel consumption. Our sustainability initiative is also based on the United Nations Agenda 2030. With the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, however, wholesalers do not have a direct influence on all of these goals. However, with the choice of our suppliers and customers, we contribute to these goals in terms of sustainability and support through sponsorships in cooperation with the organization Plan International Children in developing countries. In addition, we are committed, for example, to promoting associations in the region. Our sustainability goals are basically controlled by our management. Nevertheless, every employee is committed to controlling himself and his colleagues. In addition, internal and external audits on certifications such as Responsible Care, ISO 50001:2011, SQAS/ ESAD II, ISO 9001:2015 ensure independent strategic control of our set sustainability goals. . 4. Depth of the value chain . The company specifies the importance of sustainability aspects for value creation and to what depth of its value chain sustainability criteria are reviewed. . The value chain of CVH Chemie-Vertrieb GmbH & Co. Hannover KG is characterized by the supply of basic and special chemicals to customers. We meet special requirements with our services. Through the personal contact of the customer managers with the customers, topics such as procurement, quality, supply security, individual problem solutions as well as application technical questions can be clarified. The responsibility of our company extends according to the thought of the Responsible Care from the procurement to the use phase up to its controlled disposal. In principle, the principle of sustainable development is anchored in the integrated management manual. Supportingly, processes, procedures and work instructions describe responsible and sustainable action. The requirements are applied in the corporate divisions and continuously intensified. Problems regarding sustainability in business relations with customers or suppliers are openly communicated and solved by our customer managers/purchaser and sales representatives in cooperation. In addition, external and internal audits identify problems and dangers and solve them together. The value chain includes: Contact with the customer: Requirements for the product such as quality, price and date, End-of-life declarations Procurement, service and sales: Core processes and thus the central business of CVH, selection of responsible manufacturers and suppliers, monitoring of the supply chain with regard to the environment, production conditions and transport routes, testing and selection of an appropriate service provider taking into account the feasibility and costs, consideration of aspects such as responsible care, environmental aspects of the customer as well as legal requirements for storage and handling hazardous substances, transmission of product specifications, safety data sheets, analysis certificates or factory certificates Logistics: through own fleet or external freight forwarders, through load records of trucks and fleetboard systems, the emissions associated with delivery are improved and minimized Recovery and disposal of chemicals: professional disposal and recycling taking into account environmental protection Building management: ongoing optimisation of energy efficiency Concrete goals and measures are defined by performance indicators and tracked and evaluated by the QS circle. Through the publication of the Responsible Annual Report, we pass on our understanding of consistency and the results of our suggestions to interested parties and customers. Internal and external audits as well as a complaint management serve as supporting processes for responsible and environmentally conscious action. Feedback in customer satisfaction analyses enables all business areas to be continuously improved and reoriented. . Performance indicators for criteria 1 to 4 . Vehicle fleet Consumption optimization by Fleetboard Application analysis . With regard to vehicle fleet consumption optimization, the driving behaviour is evaluated monthly. These evaluations raise our drivers' awareness of their driving behaviour and show them on a monthly basis where there is need for improvement. . Internal indicators . Services, waste . 5. Responsibility . The responsibilities in corporate management for sustainability are disclosed. . The responsibility lies with the management or with the management in the locations, i.e. at the top management level. The sustainability program was also initiated by the management. Nevertheless, every employee of the CVH Group is committed to a sustainable and environmentally conscious action. For example, regular, internal training for the employees takes place. . 6. Rules and processes . The company discloses how the sustainability strategy is implemented through rules and processes in the operational business. . Chemie-Vertrieb GmbH & Co. Hannover KG has implemented its sustainability and corporate strategy in the form of process instructions into the ongoing business process. The integrated quality management system according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 ensures that all processes are documented and adapted if necessary. Regular internal quality management training/meetings for employees ensure that everyone involved in the business process can contribute their concerns to this system in order to continuously improve it. In addition, the Responsible Care Initiative of the chemical industry is an important basis for all business processes. This system is regularly reviewed both through internal and external audits. This ensures continuous further development, including environmental protection and work safety. Another important cornerstone of our sustainability strategy is the responsible use of resources. In the course of this, an energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001:2011 was implemented in the whole CVH group and in 2018 the most current energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001:2015 was introduced. Also, the use of a modern fleet and an efficient supply rhythm of our customers helps to save energy and reduces CO emissions to a large extent. Thus, not only resources are spared, but also the negative ecological effects are significantly minimized. The CVH group is also in a continuous improvement process. In addition, employees are stopped for waste separation and paper saving. . 7. Control . The company discloses how and which performance indicators are used for sustainability in regular internal planning and control. It explains how appropriate processes ensure reliability, comparability and consistency of data for internal control and external communication. . Energy demand divided by truck, passenger car, heating energy and electricity; emissions of CO2 emissions (by fleet); waste divided by hazardous and non-hazardous waste related to seizure at the customer; regular employee satisfaction analysis; accidents at work and resulting missing days; end-of-life declarations; employee training (training needs analysis) . Performance indicators on sustainability : Further performance indicators such as fluctuation rate and disease rate are also used for corporate controlling. In addition, the CVH Group regularly conducts internal and external audits, e.g.: DIN EN ISO 50001:2015, DIN EN ISO 9001:2015, Responsible Care, SQAS and Fami QS. . Performance indicators for criteria 5 to 7 . Performance Indicator G4-56 Describe the values, principles and standards of conduct and conduct (codes of conduct and ethics) of the organization. . CVH is aware of corporate social responsibility. Respect for human rights, fair working conditions, equal rights, equal opportunities and non-discrimination are guidelines for our business activities. CVH ensures that when selecting its suppliers, they are equally committed to these principles. CVH is committed to ensuring compliance with social standards. In Germany, corresponding laws and legislation, including the ban on the employment of children, the protection of working young people, the prohibition of forced labour, working time restrictions, freedom of association (e.g. of workers' organisations), occupational safety and equal opportunities, are regulated. Compliance with these regulations is a matter of course for the CVH Group and its employees operating in Germany and can be checked at any time by customers, suppliers or authorities. CVH is committed to the preservation of ethics and morals in business life and requires its employees to always act in accordance with the applicable law as well as the company's internal guidelines. This includes compliance with all legal regulations and prohibitions, the protection of business secrets and data protection, as well as compliance with self-imposed codes of conduct and competition law. CVH also requires its suppliers to feel obliged to these values. . Incentive schemes . The company discloses how the target agreements and remuneration for managers and employees are also oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and long-term value creation. It is disclosed to what extent the achievement of these goals is part of the evaluation of the top management level (CEO/CEO) by the supervisory board. . Sustainability is not yet a fixed or explicitly mentioned component in the target agreements and remunerations of our employees in the office. However, it is assumed that it is. Most importantly, commercial indicators are currently an indicator of the target agreements. Most of our employees receive a basic salary with a variable salary share that is oriented towards the raw profit. Cost savings can be achieved through efficient planning of tours and goods deliveries. This has a positive effect on the variable salary and thus represents an incentive for sustainable action. With our trucks drivers we have created a direct incentive. These receive premiums for a particularly efficient and predictive driving method. Driving is carried out with Fleetboard, a system that provides information on consumption, service life and braking behaviour, among other things. In addition, there is a non-monetary system. By commending the driving style of our drivers in monthly discussions, a motivational increase is achieved, which leads to our drivers continuously improving. The achievement of our sustainability goals is controlled by the shareholders at the advisory board meetings. The management of the CVH Group is obliged to submit an annual report to the advisory board. This report also addresses, among other things, the sustainability goals and certifications. Furthermore, the achievement of the goals is controlled by annual internal and external audits (e.g. ISO 50001:2011, ISO 2015:9001, Responsible Care). . Performance indicators for criterion 8 . Performance Indicator G4-51a Compensation Policy \\u2013 Report on the remuneration policy for the highest supervisory body and senior executives. . The highest supervisory body (advisory board) does not receive any remuneration. Like all other employees, the executives participate in the company's overall result via a variable salary share. . Performance Indicator G4-54 Specify the ratio of the annual remuneration of the highest paid employee in each country with significant business activities to the average level (median) of the total annual remuneration of all employees (excluding the highest paid employee) in the same country. . No figures are currently collected for this, as so far not relevant. . 9. Participation of Stakeholder Groups . The company discloses how social and economically relevant stakeholders are identified and integrated into the sustainability process. It discloses whether and how a continuous dialogue with them is maintained and how its results are integrated into the sustainability process. . Economically relevant stakeholders are identified with the help of the quality management system. These include: - suppliers (certificates, audits) - customers (audits, final declarations) - employees - promotion of regional associations Gl\\u00fccksmesse e.V. - godmother - customer surveys - supplier discussions In dialogue with these stakeholders, an evaluation of e.g. suppliers - and customer surveys takes place regularly. In addition, during customer visits as well as supplier audits, the topic of sustainability in cooperation is discussed in principle, documented in reports and subsequently kept up with the resulting activities (CVH Initiative for Sustainability). In the course of changing market conditions, product and service developments as well as legal requirements, we see the further development of sustainability management as a continuous process. . Performance indicators for criterion 9 . Performance Indicator G4-27 Name the most important issues and concerns that have arisen through stakeholder involvement and how the organisation has responded to those important issues and concerns, including through reporting. Name the stakeholder groups that have addressed the key issues and concerns. . In cooperation with our customers, the topic of delivery bundling has arisen. The reason for this was isolated complaints about too high traffic volumes. For this reason, we also try to optimize the number of deliveries with other customers. Through regular customer satisfaction analyses, supplier surveys and employee satisfaction analyses, our stakeholders have the opportunity to inform us of their concerns. . 10. Innovation and product management . The company discloses how it contributes through appropriate processes to improving the sustainability of its own resource use and users through innovations in products and services. It also explains whether and how their current and future impact is assessed in the value chain and in the product lifecycle for the essential products and services. . As a wholesale trade, the main resource consumption results from buildings, vehicles and internal processes (e.g. IT) as well as indirectly from the product range. In order to create conditions for higher energy efficiency, modern, resource-efficient building and vehicle technology is continuously invested. In the course of this development, e.g. all illuminants were replaced by energy-saving LED bulbs. Each employee is encouraged by proper ventilation and heating to continuously minimize the gas consumption. Due to the economical handling of paper (bead-side printing, unused printed paper as a note/lubrication slip) paper wastes are to be avoided. Innovative fleetboard systems in the trucks as well as well thought-out route planning are to achieve an efficient and environmentally friendly driving method. An important aspect is the use of innovative packaging techniques (IBC, Safe-Tainer, etc.) that ensure the safe transport of chemicals. We take over the reliable distribution, bottling, storage and safe transport for the closed circuit systems with special double-walled safety containers (fass-in-container system). They enable an emission-free transfer of chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons for the sustainable protection of man and the environment. Thanks to our sustainable deposit system, all containers are pawned, subjected to cleaning after use and reused. In the Metaclean area, products are developed for special requirements and applications of our customers. Care is taken to ensure that the products are manufactured under the globally recognized safety and environmental standards. In dialogue with our business partners, sustainable development plays an important role for us along the value chain. It is very important to us that we work with our customers GEMEINSAM for a sustainable development of our business relationship. We do not come with a finished solution \\\" X\\\" instead optimizes our business in cooperation. Through an active cooperation and the common interest to make it as sustainable as possible, we help our customers, for example, to exchange dangerous products for their employees through harmless alternatives or special formulations. Through efficient tour planning in cooperation with our customers' buyers, it is also possible to bundle journeys, so that there are no routes for small quantities of goods. In the course of Responsible Care, the areas such as occupational health and health protection, environmental protection and transport safety are consolidated and improved by regular training and training. . Performance indicators for criterion 10 . Performance indicator G4-FS11 Percentage of financial assets subject to a positive or negative selection test according to environmental or social factors. . Financial investments are carried out exclusively at our parent companies. . 11. Utilization of natural resources . The company discloses the extent to which natural resources are used for business activities, including materials as well as the input and output of water, soil, waste, energy, area, biodiversity and emissions for the life cycle of products and services. . \\\"Sustainability as a common success factor.\\\" According to our sustainability initiative, we not only want to talk about this, but also integrate this idea firmly into all business processes. Our consumption consists of the use of electricity, gas and water for our office activities, as well as diesel and petrol as fuel for our own transporting truck fleet and external sales. With the introduction and certification of energy management according to DIN:ISO50001:2011, the above-mentioned consumptions and the associated CO emissions per location are recorded and evaluated. This ensures the necessary transparency with the problem zones can be optimized. Our goal is to continuously improve energy efficiency or reduce consumption. In the annual training sessions, employees are regularly sensitized with regard to the correct use of resources and are called upon to participate in process and process improvement. The behaviour, participation and schools of our employees are another key factor for continuous improvement. The CVH Group sells a wide range of basic and specialty chemicals. When selecting suppliers, particular attention is paid to manufacturing processes. This is to be done as energy-efficiently and sustainably as possible. These points are controlled by regular audits. In the context of Responsible Care, the CVH Group is obliged to analyse and minimize negative influences in the various processes of the value chain. This is also supported by our QM system. . 12. Resource management . The Company shall disclose the qualitative and quantitative objectives it has set for its resource efficiency, in particular the use of renewable energies, the increase in raw material productivity and the reduction of the use of ecosystem services, the measures and strategies it pursues, how they have been or are to be fulfilled in the future and where it sees risks. . CVH is committed to a sustainable energy policy and is committed to continuously reducing energy consumption, especially in the areas of passenger cars/trucks and buildings, as well as the associated CO emissions, in compliance with the statutory requirements. In order to achieve these goals, an energy management system DIN:ISO50001 was introduced together with the CG Group in the framework of a matrix certification. The reduction of the energy index (kWh/to warehouse sales) and the absolute values of electricity and natural gas across groups by 2020 has been reduced by 8%, in relation to 2015. In addition, the CVH Group strives for a continuous annual improvement of 2% in the procurement of the resources electricity and gas. In addition, special attention is paid to the origin (100% eco-electricity). Water consumption is limited to the one in the office building, as the CVH Group has no own production. Risks resulting from the business activities of our products and services are recorded in a risk management system annually reviewed and updated! Since we have no own production result the only risks from our transport business. . Performance indicators for criteria 11 to 12 . Performance indicator G4-EN1 Materials used by weight or volume. . No production takes place at our locations. Our suppliers take over the production, so no information can be provided on this. . Performance indicator G4-EN3 Energy consumption within the organisation. . - electricity consumption - electricity source 100% green electricity - fuel car / truck - gas consumption (heating) . Performance indicator G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption. . The goal is to reduce total energy consumption across groups by 8% by 2020, relative to 2015. All energy sources listed under the G4-EN3 power indicator are determined and evaluated quarterly. 2015: 3,365.259 kW/h 2018: 2,875.730 kW/h This results in a reduction of 14,55%. . Performance indicator G4-EN8 Total water abstraction by source. . At this time, there is no determination of the annual water consumption. The water consumption in the CVH group refers only to the operation of the sanitary installations and the collection of employees e.g. in kitchens. This water comes from the regional drinking water network. . Performance indicator G4-EN23 Total weight of waste by type and method of disposal. . There is no survey of the total weight of the waste, since it is only office waste that is handed over to the regional disposers. . 13. Climate-related emissions . The company discloses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol or standards based on it and sets its own emission reduction targets. . In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, there are two main emission sources in the CVH Group. Our fleet and the emissions generated in our locations with the consumption of gas and electricity. In the sense of our certified energy management system according to DIN:ISO50001:2011, the consumption of vehicles is recorded and the associated CO emissions per location are recorded and evaluated. This applies to all our vehicles trucks and cars. All trucks in the CVH Group fleet have installed the latest Euro 6 engines. In the new acquisition of vehicles, attention is also paid to the fact that each new vehicle emits less climate-relevant emissions than the predecessor. The emissions that occur in the sense of business activities in our offices are limited to the consumption of electricity and gas and the resulting output. CVH receives 100% green electricity from a local energy supplier. In order to reduce long-term electricity consumption, as possible all bulbs in LED lamps were changed in 2018. . Performance indicators for criterion 13 . Performance indicator G4-EN15 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1). . CO emissions are determined by the analysis of fuel consumption of cars/lorries, electricity consumption and the consumption of gas for heating systems. 2015: 1434 tonnes CO 2018: 1312 tonnes CO This corresponds to a reduction of 8.51% . G4-EN16 Indirect energy related GHG emissions (Scope 2). . For this purpose, the CVH Group does not collect any data, since the business activity only requires electricity, gas and water for the office and warehouse buildings. Thus, no above-average consumptions such as in industrial plants occur. The CVH Group obtains eco-electricity from regional energy suppliers. . Performance indicator G4-EN17 Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). . The CVH group does not collect data for this purpose (see: G4-EN16). . Performance indicator G4-EN19 Reduction of GHG emissions. . A continuous reduction of GHG emissions is one of our goals.

Workers' rights . The company reports on how it complies with nationally and internationally recognised standards on employee rights and promotes the participation of employees in the company and in the company's sustainability management, which goals it sets itself, which results have been achieved so far and where it sees risks. . Respect for workers' rights is a fundamental issue in the philosophy of the CVH Group and is enshrined in our internal code of conduct. The CVH Group only operates nationally and respects the ILO core labour standards. Therefore, employees also get more holidays than is required by law. Through audit mechanisms of the integrated management system, it is ensured that all workers' rights are respected. In order to be able to compete, we need motivated and competent employees who work with our company. The satisfaction of the employees plays a decisive role in this, because employees who are placed in a positive position over their tasks make full use of their performance potential and thus ensure the long-term success of the CVH Group. The results of the employee satisfaction analyses serve as the basis for the introduction of suitable measures to improve employee satisfaction. The sensitization of the employees to the sustainability idea takes place in regular meetings. The risk of a fluctuation of well-trained employees goes in the CVH Group towards zero. . 15. Equal opportunities . The company discloses how it implements national and international processes and what goals it has to promote equal opportunities and diversity, occupational safety and health protection, participation, integration of migrants and people with disabilities, adequate pay and agreement of family and work, and how it implements them. .

Through targeted investments, we want to ensure maximum operational and occupational safety and to act economically sustainable. In order to promote the health of our employees, every employee can use free sports offers in a nearby fitness studio. The CVH Group pays all employees over-tariff. Every employee can participate in the company's development via a variable salary share. For our management, the principle that every employee in the company contributes significantly to the company's success is clear from our commission model. Reconciliation of family and work is very important to the CVH Group. By means of a working time model that allows half-day work, parental leave and an effortless transition back to full-day work, this is possible. In addition, the CVH Group attaches great importance to equality and the employment of people with disabilities. . (ii) the need to improve the quality of training; . The company discloses the objectives it has set and the measures it has taken to promote employability, i.e. the ability to participate in the working and professional world of all employees, and to adapt it to demographic trends, and where it sees risks. .

The goal of the management is to secure a competitive advantage through motivated and qualified employees. A key goal. The termination rate in the group is <1%. Thus, the CVH Group constantly promotes the lifelong learning of its employees. The health of the employees also plays an important role. Employees can use fitness offers free of charge. In addition, work on height-adjustable tables is possible, for example, if there is a need. Our drivers and warehouse workers are always equipped with the latest technology and safe work clothing.

After exceeding our 2020 carbon emissions reduction target, we have set a vision of achieving net-zero by 2050, and we are working with the Science Based Targets initiative to determine the goals that support this vision. - From an innovation perspective, our Neptune liquid cooling technology, combined with our High-Performance Computing cluster, helps data center customers become more energy efficient. For example, they enable our customer, DreamWorks Animation, to cut power consumption by a third while increasing the amount of computing power per square foot of its existing data center by more than a hundredfold, which creates a real-time rendering process for creative artists. - Lenovo has continued its focus on resource preservation and supporting a circular economy by increasing the use of recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, increasing the use of bio-based materials, reducing the size of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and reusable packaging solutions that help to reduce carbon emissions. Since 2012, we have been using bamboo fiber in packaging, a renewable, bio-based and lightweight material. We have continued to increase our use of this material - , and are now using it in the packaging for more than one million products each year. In FY 2021/22, we expanded our use of bamboo fiber to include the ThinkPad X1 and Z series gift boxes, thus reducing the transportation weight by 30 percent. - During the last several years, the world has witnessed history quickly unfold as we live through significant complexity and uncertainty. Many of the persistent challenges that humanity has faced during this period require continued attention, including combating climate change, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19, and narrowing the digital divide. We are all learning to live with the new reality created by these challenges that continue to cause broader concerns about peace and prosp - erity for all. - We have continued to expand Lenovo\\u2019s renewable energy installation as we work to achieve our energy-related targets. The total in-operation renewable energy capacity in our worldwide locations has now reached approximately 17 megawatts, with more in the plan. - Furthermore, our efforts to effectively engage with suppliers on climate change were acknowledged when we achieved a CDP score of \\u201cA\\u201d for our 2021 Supplier Engagement Rating in Climate Change, and we were also listed on the Supplier Engagement Rating Leader Board along with a total of 518 companies. - This rapidly changing context urges the global business community to respond with smarter innovation and more responsible operations, seizing every opportunity to act with a larger purpose in mind. Business practices need to comply with laws and regulations as well as high ethical standards and moral imperatives. Lenovo is committed to our vision to provide smarter technology for all and helping to decarbonize the global economy \\u2013 one of humanity\\u2019s greatest challenges. With that, I am proud to s - hare our environmental, social and governance progress over the past year and our goals for the future. - Lenovo understands that building resiliency and mitigating the effects of climate change are efforts that require collaboration and innovation across businesses and industries. We\\u2019ve established the Lenovo 360 ESG circle with select channel partners to share joint commitments. We also offer a series of sustainable services, such as asset recovery services for products approaching the end of their lifecycle, including data removal, machine refurbishment, and sustainable material reuse. These effo - rts can help our customers achieve sustainability targets while enabling corporate citizenship as a business driver. - 4\\n\\nBuilding an Equitable and Inclusive Society\\n\\nOperating with Integrity, Ethics and Compliance - We believe technology connects people, enables productivity, and creates possibilities. Therefore, it must be inclusive and accessible to all, especially those most in need of it. Last year, we continued to respond to waves of the COVID-19 outbreaks globally. For example, Lenovo\\u2019s charitable arm, the Lenovo Foundation, partnered with nonprofits and disaster relief organizations to help fund and establish the first mobile hospital unit in Bengaluru, India to help battle the pandemic. - Lenovo has made it a priority to comply with laws and regulations and uphold high ethical standards everywhere we do business. Lenovo fully supports the call for the global tech sector to do business fairly, ethically, and transparently. We take security seriously, from product and data security, and from cybersecurity to information privacy. We believe that only with accountability and transparency will we continue to win trust from our customers and stakeholders globally. - In 2021, the Company launched its fifth annual Global Month of Service with participation from employees across 66 countries who collectively contributed over 10,000 volunteer hours to serve their communities. This annual event provided a great opportunity for employees to work closely with local schools and education centers and make a difference in many lives. The Company\\u2019s goal is to impact 15 million people by 2025 through our social partnerships and programs. - A key focus for us is supporting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education to drive positive change. Last year, I made a personal donation of RMB100 million (US$15 million) to help my alma mater, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, build a new facility with a cutting-edge High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center that will improve its computing capabilities and facilitate research and innovation. Over the next three years, Lenovo will sponsor the equivalent of RMB 200 million (US$30 m - illion) to Shanghai Jiao Tong University to support its three-year mission to drive leading scientific research, nurture new talent, and incubate new technologies. - Our ESG efforts have received the highest-ever rating and the best overall industry score for the IT industry from the 2021 Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index, reaching an AA+ rating for the first time. Lenovo has been included in the ranking since 2010, with each consecutive year marking the company\\u2019s ongoing commitment and progress in ESG. - In summary, FY 2021/22 marks another year of Lenovo\\u2019s significant progress and strong external recognition of its environmental, social and governance efforts. Some additional highlights include:\\n\\nFor the third consecutive year, Lenovo was included in Corporate Knights 2022 Global 100 as one of the 100 most sustainable companies in the world.\\n\\nLenovo was included in the highly regarded 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. - Lenovo was selected into the 2022 Gartner Supply Chain Top 25.\\n\\nTo build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive society, I believe we need to start with our workplace. After achieving our three-year target of female executive representation in 2020, we\\u2019ve set the target to increase global female executive representation to 27 percent and executives from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial groups in the U.S. to 35 percent by FY 2025/26. - I\\u2019m pleased to announce a step forward in Lenovo\\u2019s advocacy for women as we commit to the United Nation\\u2019s Women\\u2019s Empowerment Principles to further promote gender equality in our organization, marketplace and communities. This platform for change guides companies to commit to gender equality by investing in and supporting women\\u2019s leadership and decision-making and supports the gender equality dimensions of the 2030 agenda and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. - Lenovo was listed among Fortune magazine\\u2019s World\\u2019s Most Admired Companies, ranking fifth in the broad computing industry.\\n\\nI\\u2019m proud of Lenovo\\u2019s ESG team, comprised of subject matter experts who continue to challenge us with higher goals and drive the company to achieve them. I am confident that despite all uncertainties around the world, Lenovo remains committed to building a smarter, brighter and more sustainable future for all. - Yang Yuanqing Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lenovo Group Limited\\n\\nA similar commitment also applies to serving more than one billion individuals around the world who live with disabilities. Lenovo\\u2019s Product Diversity Office works with inclusive design experts and will review 75 percent of Lenovo products by 2025 to ensure they work for everyone, regardless of physical attributes or abilities. - Our efforts have earned us external recognition. We\\u2019ve won 24 best employer and best workplace awards around the world, including recognitions for gender equality, disability inclusion, and LGBTQ+ Equality.\\n\\n5\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n, - j\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nA Message from our Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer\\n\\nStarting with a Vision - Having a clear and compelling vision helps define a company\\u2019s role in society and guides how it operates, supports issues, and engages with all stakeholders. Vision must be backed by meaningful actions and tangible goals. For Lenovo, our vision to provide smarter technology for all is engrained into all aspects of our business and drives our overall ESG efforts. By centering our company around our vision and aligning our commitments to it, we are reminded to continue working to build a brighter, - more sustainable future for our stakeholders and the planet. - Leading with Credibility - The disruptive toll on our planet is nearing a point of no return and there has never been greater urgency to address climate change. This heightened public concern has provoked many commitments from companies and institutions. Lenovo acknowledges the complexity of a global transition to a low-carbon economy and the amount of collaboration and innovation required. Lenovo supported the development of a standard aligned with the latest climate science and was selected to road test the Science Base - d Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard before it was launched in October 2021. We also performed an initial financial and feasibility study to size the next steps to support a path to net-zero by 2050. - I\\u2019ve witnessed many corporations respond to the unprecedented challenges of the past several years with an accelerated focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. And like many other organizations, we remain steadfast on our ESG journey as we learn to navigate the world and events that challenge even the strongest organizations. - In March 2022, we signed the SBTi Commitment Letter pledging to set net-zero targets, including a long-term science-based target by aligning with 1.5\\u00b0C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5\\u00b0C campaign. To further support SBTI\\u2019s call for corporate action, we also joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Race to Zero campaign, a broad coalition of organizations committing to set science-based targets to help build a prosperous, net-zero carbon economy - by 2050. - During FY 2021/22, Lenovo remained focused on developing innovative solutions that reshaped the way we conduct business around the world and helped to preserve the ecosystems on which our future depends. Despite disruptions, we are transforming risks into opportunities that can support our long-term growth. Even more, we are taking steps to promote a culture from the top-down to ensure ESG considerations are integrated with the business decision-making process. - Global operation comes with a global responsibility\\n\\nBusinesses of all sizes have the opportunity to build ESG commitments into day-to-day operations. However, those with a global footprint have an even greater obligation to use their size and scale as a force for good and influence those within their supply chains across markets. As a global company, we recognize our fundamental responsibilities in the areas\\n\\n6 - of ESG in the markets where we operate as we strive to integrate related values and principles wherever we conduct business. Lenovo\\u2019s Code of Conduct mandates compliance with applicable laws in markets where we conduct business, and our policies strongly support ethical and responsible business practices. - Putting Accountability at the Forefront\\n\\nFor the fifth consecutive year, Lenovo was included in the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation\\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, and received a score of 100 with the distinction of \\u201cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality\\u201d. The Index is the premier benchmarking survey on corporate policies and practices for LGBTQ workplace equality in the United States. - Developing ESG goals and initiatives that support a resilient way forward can simultaneously create long-term value for stakeholders. An effective way to achieve progress is through a collective dedication to holding ourselves \\u2013 and each other \\u2013 accountable. At Lenovo, we establish internal accountability through the ESG Executive Oversight Committee (EOC), which provides strategic direction and facilitates the coordination of ESG efforts across Lenovo. The ESG EOC is comprised of senior managem - ent from across the business and functional areas and is chartered to promote a culture that encourages strong ESG performance, including compliance and leadership activities. - For the ninth consecutive year, Lenovo received a Gold Award of \\u201cMost Sustainable Companies\\u201d from The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA)\\u2019s 2021 Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards. - As we look ahead, we will continue to leverage our strengths as we seek opportunities that improve our ESG performance and support our growth. Our genuine endeavors aim to be more than good intentions. Guided by our higher purpose, we will continue our ESG focus and demonstrate resilience by remaining steadfast on the long-term, listening to our stakeholders\\u2019 needs, and supporting our vision to provide smarter technology for all. - Demonstrating Measured Progress in ESG\\n\\nThroughout this ESG Report, we share the progress we\\u2019ve made as well as outline our goals that support our long-term vision. We are proud of what we have accomplished together, despite the many challenges. Once again, we have proven to be a united, dependable organization that rises to the challenge and conquers difficulty. In FY 2021/2022, our ESG activities reached important milestones, and some received external recognitions, including: - John Cerretani Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer Lenovo Group Limited - Lenovo was included in the 2021 CDP A list for water and received an A- for climate. CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) assesses companies on the comprehensiveness of climate and water disclosures, awareness and management of environmental risks, and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets. - September 2021 marked Lenovo\\u2019s fifth annual Love on Global Month of Service, inviting employees in 66 countries around the world to make a positive social impact in their communities. Projects were aligned with Lenovo Foundation\\u2019s mission to empower underrepresented populations with access to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the employee volunteer event grew by participating offices (+52%), number of volunteers (+17%), and number - of beneficiaries (+9%) since 2020. - 7\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nLenovo Group Limited 2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance Report\\n\\n8\\n\\nLenovo Group Limited 2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance Report - 2.0 About this Report\\n\\n10\\n\\nAbout this Report\\n\\n11\\n\\nMaterial Topics\\n\\n13\\n\\nOrganizational Profile\\n\\n14\\n\\nSupporting the U.N.

The Company\\u2019s EMS requires sites to characterize their discharges before entering into an agreement with a treatment facility (exceptions may exist for typical sanitary waste), to not discharge constituents for which a treatment facility does n - ot have treatment capability, to update characterization when a site\\u2019s activities change, and to adhere, as applicable, to the discharge limits of local law, the treatment facility, and any associated permits. - In addition, in celebration of World Water Day 2022 and to support the importance of increased water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, the Lenovo Foundation announced a global partnership with Wine To Water (W|W), a non-profit organization committed to supporting life and dignity for all through the power of clean water. - The Company\\u2019s EMS includes annual global water targets. For the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the targets were to maintain per person water withdrawal (volumes not to exceed a 5 percent increase compared to the FY 2020/21 reporting period) and perform a water withdrawal and risk analysis of the Company\\u2019s operations. These targets were achieved through maintaining operational control of water withdrawals, local targets at select sites, and analysis of site water withdrawal volumes and local water - risk indicators determined using publicly available tools. The results of the Company\\u2019s environmental targets are available in Section 8.0. - The Company requires sites to report environmental incidents, including water-related incidents, through its internal environmental database. During the FY 2021/22, there was one water-related incident. In 2021, the Company received a violation for a lapse in a sewage discharge permit for a site under construction. As part of this, the Company renewed the permit and paid a fine of approximately US$4,000. In addition to internal reporting, the Company\\u2019s manufacturing facilities undergo periodic a - udits some of which cover aspects of WASH and water management. For more information on audits at the Company\\u2019s facilities, see Section 4.0. - During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company continued to measure and monitor water use and risk. In the Company\\u2019s direct operations, the primary use of water is for WASH services for employees, contractors and visitors in its facilities around the globe. Because the Company\\u2019s primary water use is employees, water use varies from location to location with its largest manufacturing facilities, the sites with the largest employee headcount, withdrawing and discharging the most water. The Co - mpany\\u2019s water data for the current reporting period is presented in Section 7.0. Annual Verification Statements for its total water withdrawal and discharge are available on the Company\\u2019s website. - While the Company has minimal wet processes, it appreciates the importance of adequate quantities of sufficient quality water to its supply chain partners with wet processes, particularly the semiconductor industry. The Company requires suppliers to adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct and the RBA Code of Conduct through contractual stipulations, both of which include water-related provisions. The Company uses RBA audits to verify compliance from the suppliers that comprise its top 95 percent - of spend. For more information on these supplier activities, see Section 6.0. - 25\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x - i\\n\\nWater risks within the Company\\u2019s operational footprint and supply chain are assessed annually using publicly available water risk tools (World Resources Institute\\u2019s Aqueduct and WWF\\u2019s Water Risk Filter Tool).

This data can then be reported to customers or other stakeholders. The Company continues to actively search for environmentally preferable materials that can be used as substitutes and expects its partners and suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment to environmentally sound practices. See the Company\\u2019s Materials Management webpage for m - ore information. - The Company restricts the use of environmentally sensitive materials in its products. This includes the prohibition of ozone-depleting substances in all applications; the restriction on the use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the Stockholm Convention; and the elimination of materials covered under European Union (EU) Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), even beyond the jurisdictions where these - regulatory requirements exist. The Company\\u2019s implementation strategy and requirements are consistent with the requirements specified in the EU\\u2019s RoHS Directive and REACH Regulation. - ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS PRODUCTS\\n\\nThe Company supports phasing out brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PVC and is committed to driving its supply chain toward this goal. The Company continues to focus on eliminating halogens from its top-selling products and across as many commodities as possible.\\n\\nProduct Materials - The Company\\u2019s corporate-wide environmental standards and specifications require its product designers to consider environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimization of resource consumption. The Company\\u2019s priority is to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. In adhering to this precautionary approach, it supports restricting the intentional addition of materials that are potentially concerning when economically and technically - viable alternatives exist. These restrictions may also include implementing concentration limits for incidental occurrences. - The Company has made progress in phasing out halogens in many commodities across several product lines, among its achievements:\\n\\nPhasing out completely the use of BFR/CFR/ PVC in all mechanical plastic parts (such as external covers, housings, etc.) across all its products\\n\\nMost of hard disk drives, optical disk drives, solid-state drives, LCD screens, memory, CPUs, chipsets, and communication cards; and other commodities with offerings meet the iNEMI definition5 of low halogen - All commercial notebooks including PCBs meet the iNEMI definition5 of low halogen except for cables and wires, AC adapter\\n\\nAll commercial monitors meet the iNEMI definition of low halogen except for their PCBA and cables. Furthermore, some monitors fully meet the iNEMI definition5 of low halogen\\n\\n26\\n\\nAll smartphone products are free of CFR and PVC\\n\\nProhibiting the intentional addition of the following pollutants to any of its parts:\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nPolybrominated Biphenyls (PBBs)\\n\\n\\u2013 - Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs)\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nDeca-Brominated Diphenyl Ethers - In addition to the regulated materials, the Company has also identified an expanded list of materials and substances of environmental interest. These substances may be candidates for further restrictions in the future. It holds suppliers accountable for reporting the use of these materials through Supplier Material Declarations. An industry-standard IPC 1752A XML Full Material Disclosure (FMD) form, submitted via an environmental compliance analysis system, is the preferred format for confirmati - on of compliance to the restrictions and for reporting when substances in question are above the specified concentration levels. - 5 The Company supports the definition of \\u201clow halogen\\u201d electronics as defined in the \\u201ciNEMI Position Statement on the \\u2018Definition of Low-Halogen\\u2019 Electronics (BFR/CFR/PVC-Free). - The Company plans to use additional BFR- and PVC-free parts and materials across the Think and Idea family of products as acceptable alternative materials become available, working toward the goal to phase out the use of these materials across all newly introduced products. The Company continues to work with its suppliers to pilot new BFR- and PVC- free applications. The Company recognizes that the phase-out of these materials is dependent upon the availability of suitable alternatives that meet - its technological, cost, quality, environmental, health, and safety requirements. - The Company\\u2019s business unit environmental engineers utilize the environmental compliance analysis system to perform a Bill of Materials (BOM) validation to ensure every part number used in building the product has the required supplier information.

This information serves as a tool that can aid structural design and optimization, analyzing materials and mechanical properties, and improving product reliability. - The Company does not exempt any of its suppliers from providing Full Material Disclosures, though it does allow considerations for confidential information. Less than five percent of component suppliers do not provide full material disclosure, usually for security or intellectual property reasons. The Company will continue its efforts to support full material disclosure. Those who do not provide Full Material Disclosures are requested to ensure their components\\u2019 compliance with its format of mat - erial disclosure, IEC 62474 declaration, test report, or self-declaration. - The Company informs its customers about the environmental attributes of its products and compliance with applicable laws and regulations through an industry-standard IT Eco Declaration form. Declarations for newly released products are posted on the Company\\u2019s ECO Declarations webpage. - The Company continues to incorporate post-industrial recycled content (PIC) plastics, post-consumer recycled content (PCC) plastics, and closed-loop post-consumer recycled plastics (CL PCR) and to introduce new materials such as ocean bound plastics and recycled metals into its products. These recycled materials are instrumental to the Company\\u2019s product development strategy and transition to a circular economy. Using these engineered plastics not only saves the natural resources and energy that - would have gone into manufacturing new plastics but also diverts these materials from landfills. The Company\\u2019s increased use of CL PCR is helping to sustain the demand for plastic materials from IT products. These environmental benefits are achieved while still creating a product that meets the Company\\u2019s high-performance standards. - The Company currently uses post-consumer recycled content in laptops, desktops, workstations, monitors, and accessories and is introducing its closed-loop process in more products each year. In 2021, the Company expanded the use of CL PCR to 248 products, up from 103 products the previous year.\\n\\nBy FY 2025/26, 100% - Consistent with its precautionary approach, the Company continuously analyzes the regulatory environment and considers input from its customers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders in the evaluation of potential health and environmental impacts of its products. The Company weighs these inputs to determine the restricted substances, as well as the substances of interest to be tracked for reporting and consideration of future restrictions. - of PC products will contain post-consumer recycled content materials. 6\\n\\n6 Excludes tablets and accessories - Using PCC in IT products presents significant challenges due to the unique structural, performance, and cosmetic requirements associated with these applications. To overcome the continuing challenges of using recycled content in the design and manufacture of smart connected devices, especially notebooks, tablets, and smartphones, the Company\\u2019s team of engineers works closely with its suppliers to develop and qualify new grades of plastic resins previously unavailable to the IT industry. These ma - terials receive environmental and performance qualifications before their approval and use in their product applications. - 28 - For CL PCR, the Company\\u2019s research and development teams work with material suppliers and a third-party certification authority to build its CL PCR supplier and material process, including the \\u201cApproved Recycling Standard\\u201d, the \\u201cQuality Assurance Operation Requirements\\u201d, and the \\u201cRecovery Ratio\\u201d to validate their sources of waste and control processes using a hierarchical waste product traceability scheme. Since early 2005, the Company\\u2019s cumulative total use of recycled plastics in products has - reached over 123 million kilograms (gross) containing PIC, PCC, and/or CL PCR, with net PCC of over 52 million kilograms and net CL PCR of more than 14 million kilograms. - In addition to recycled plastics mentioned above, during the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company began incorporating ocean bound plastics (OBP) and recycled metals in its products. In an effort to reduce ocean pollution, the Company researched and sourced OBP for use in some products. In 2021, the Company introduced OBP content in the speakers of ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 and ThinkPad L13 Yoga Gen 3, and speakers, dummy smart cards, and dummy SIM covers of the ThinkPad L14 Gen 3, and ThinkPad L15 - Gen 3, and C14 Gen 1 Chromebook. - In 2021, the Company\\u2019s use of plastics containing recycled content was approximately 7.8 million kilograms (gross) with a net CL PCR of approximately 4.6 million kilograms. While the Company continues to introduce plastics containing recycled content to more and more products, these usage annual numbers have tended to decrease over time which reflects the Company\\u2019s decreasing use of plastics overall resulting from successful efforts to make products thinner and lighter. - Results of the Company\\u2019s progress against its recycled content usage targets are available in Section 8.0. The Company\\u2019s ESG KPIs include recycled content KPIs, for more information see Section 9.0. - Recycled metal usage also supports the transition to a more circular economy. Recycled metal usage helps reduce mining and consumption of natural resources and has energy and emissions savings. In 2021, the Company introduced 75 percent recycled aluminum for the A/C covers of the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 and ThinkPad Z16 Gen 1, and 50 percent recycled aluminum for the A cover of the Yoga 6 Gen 7, and 90 percent recycled magnesium for the A/C covers of the ThinkPad X13s Gen 1. - The Company will begin reporting on the total weight of OBP and recycled metals in the next ESG Report.\\n\\nMilestones for the Company during the past four years in recycled content usage includes:\\n\\n2021\\n\\nExpanded the use of CL PCR to 248 products \\u2022 Introduced Ocean Bound Plastics in \\ufb01ve products \\u2022 Introduced recycled aluminum in three products and magnesium in one product\\n\\n2020 - Expanded the use of CL PCR to 103 products, up from 66 products the previous year \\u2022 Began using CL PCR in a server application for the \\ufb01rst time in the Company\\u2019s ThinkSystem SR950\\n\\n2019\\n\\nExpanded use of CL PCR to 66 additional products \\u2022 1st Use of CL PCR in Lenovo notebook application (X1 Carbon 7th Generation) \\u2022 Desktop and visual models with >25% CL PCR by total product weight\\n\\n2018 - Quali\\ufb01ed new grades of CL PCR for additional resin chemistries and suppliers \\u2022 Expanded use of CL PCR to 21 products (added keyboards)\\n\\n29\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni - In April 2022, the Company was acknowledged as a contributor to a first of a kind research report on plastic pollution, \\u201cPlastic Pollution Prevention and Control in China\\u201d.

The Company designs its products to maximize its product lifecycle by focusing on durability and repairability. - To keep products in use, the Company offers three-year standard warranties and five years of replacement parts availability on many of its top-selling commercial PC products to support this extended lifecycle. Three-year warranties are offered as the base warranty on many top-selling Think branded products, including all commercial monitors, notebooks, desktops, and others. In addition, customers can purchase warranty upgrades to extend the base warranty by one or two years for many products. Ba - se warranties for consumer (Idea) products vary by product type and geography but typically start at one to two years for the base warranty with the option for many products to purchase an extended warranty. - Many of the Company\\u2019s embedded batteries are designed to last two to three times longer than standard batteries. It offers three-year warranty upgrades on many embedded batteries. The longer lifespan is made possible with carefully selected cells and charge algorithms.\\n\\nIn July 2021, the Company began working with a battery manufacturer to develop a mobile battery with a longer life of 1200 cycles (up from the current 800 cycles). - Product Carbon Footprint\\n\\nThere are numerous and substantial challenges to calculating an accurate carbon footprint for information and communications technology (ICT) products, especially if the intent is to use the data for product-to-product comparisons. These challenges include: - In addition to the warranty offerings, the Company makes service and maintenance manuals for most products along with parts removal and replacement videos. Customers can source spare parts from the Company or authorized partners. The Company\\u2019s serviceability engineers are focused on minimizing the interruption to customers during repair and maintenance and consider the products\\u2019 eligibility for onsite repair as an indicator for ease of repair. - Collecting and compiling dependable emissions data across a long and complicated supply chain\\n\\nAccurately allocating emissions from facilities across different geographies providing numerous products and services to multiple customers\\n\\nMaintaining current data with a continuously evolving and rapidly changing ICT product portfolio - For more details, see the Company\\u2019s Warranty and Maintenance Services webpage. The Company\\u2019s ESG KPIs include a repairability KPI, for more information see Section 9.0.\\n\\nEnsuring consistency of results in an environment where multiple and varying calculation methodologies are available - The Company is continuously designing innovative features for its products to help extend their useful life. For example, its battery technology extends notebook battery cycle life through key technologies, including:\\n\\nIncreased use of lithium polymer cells: Used in notebooks and tablets with embedded batteries, these cells typically provide longer life cycles than lithium-ion cylindrical cells. - The Company continues to search for an efficient and credible way to calculate its product footprints, and it also wants to understand the impacts while credibly disclosing environmental information about its products. With these challenges and goals, the Company joined the Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm (PAIA) Project, an ICT sector-wide pre-competitive collaboration led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to streamline footprints for ICT products. To help address these c - hallenges, MIT developed PAIA, an easy-to-use online platform that allows companies to significantly reduce the time and cost of environmental impact calculations. - 32\\n\\nWith a suite of simplified online tools, PAIA delivered a methodology for ICT product footprints which originated from a multi-stakeholder initiative of ICT companies that shared insights and best practices. The Company\\u2019s participation in PAIA is helping to drive a sector-wide streamlined methodology that will be key to transforming ICT companies into sustainable businesses. - The PAIA PCF calculation tools help to efficiently calculate product carbon footprint (PCF) for a wide range of products and configurations. The Company\\u2019s product development groups currently use the PAIA tools for notebooks, desktops, workstations, monitors, all-in-ones, tablets, thin clients, servers, network switches, and storage products and are engaged in optimization of the online platform. - The Company\\u2019s product LCA system is based on the ICT industry eco-design requirements that analyzes the product\\u2019s full life cycle and design process to help provide products with less environmental impact to the market. Its product LCA system utilizes the ICT product footprint tool which assesses the core product design and manufacturing plan by using a scientific and quantitative configuration that supports improvement initiatives. In 2021, the Company conducted 10 product LCAs for Notebook, Di - splay, Tablet, Mobile phone and Accessories and is working to expand this exercise to more products. The 10 products are: ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9, ThinkPad X13 Gen 2, ThinkVision P27q-20, ThinkVision P27q-2L, ThinkVision P27h-20, ThinkVision P27h-2L, Lenovo TB-X6C6, Lenovo TB-J606, Lenovo TB-J607, XT2143-1, XT2153-1, ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 Workstation Dock DK2131. - While there are other voluntary standards available to guide practitioners in compiling PCF, these standards are not designed to establish comparative values between products. The degree of flexibility written into the standards can produce variations in results for the same products when the same standard is applied by different practitioners. Compiling PCF using these standards is also a very lengthy and resource-intensive process. Other commonly used standards include the British Standards In - stitute\\u2019s PAS 2050, WRI/WBCSD\\u2019s GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Accounting and Reporting Standard, ISO 14040, ISO 14044 \\u2013 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and ISO 14067 \\u2013 Carbon Footprint of Products. - Using PAIA tools to calculate product footprints has significantly reduced the time and cost of calculating environmental footprints for its products. The quality and accuracy of the calculations allow the Company to confidently communicate this information with customers and other stakeholders. The Company shares these results with enterprise customers and publishes them publicly as PCF information sheets. PCF sheets for specific products can be found on the Company\\u2019s ECO Declarations webpage. - 33\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni - Ecolabels from around the Globe\\n\\nThe Company pursues ecolabels for many of its products.

The Company\\u2019s supply base is comprised of the following categories: internal manufacturing centers, production procurement, original design manufacturers (ODM), and general procurement. Production procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials or components that become part of the Company\\u2019s products. ODMs include manufacturing partne - rs who manufacture products on behalf of the Company. - General procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials and products which support the Company\\u2019s operations but do not become part of its products. The Company\\u2019s supply base is comprised of multiple tiers in which lower tiers of suppliers provide materials and parts to higher tiers \\u2013 and eventually to its Tier 1 suppliers, the suppliers with whom the Company has a direct contractual relationship. - The disclosures in this report apply to the Company\\u2019s production procurement supplier base. The majority of the Company\\u2019s spend is with production - procurement suppliers which often have ESG impact and risk. Production procurement suppliers can have social risks because they require substantial labor forces and have access to large, lower-skilled labor pools that are vulnerable to exploitation. Production procurement suppliers may generally also have environmental impacts through the energy, water, and materials required for production.\\n\\nDistribution of Suppliers - The Company recognizes there are many benefits in utilizing local suppliers, including decreased logistics costs, potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions, and the opportunity to support local economies and maintain community relationships. The Company considers local suppliers as those that operate in the same country as its significant locations of operations. In FY 2021/22, its significant locations of operations included manufacturing locations in China, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, - Hungary, Japan, and India. The Company estimates that 90 percent of production supply spend in China is with local suppliers. In other manufacturing geographies, the Company estimates that 20 percent of spend is with local suppliers. The chart below shows the geographic distribution of the Company\\u2019s 550 production suppliers in FY 2021/22: - 35 Europe\\n\\n11 India\\n\\n6 Latin America\\n\\n131 North America\\n\\nRegion\\n\\n224 Chinese mainland\\n\\n143 Asia Paci\\ufb01c\\n\\nThe allocation pie chart based on the registered legal entity of the headquarters of suppliers\\n\\n82\\n\\nSupply Chain Process Overview\\n\\nThe most capable suppliers are selected based on the best overall acquisition value - The Company considers the supply chain a vital part of its operations and views effective supply chain management as an important contributor to its success. Given this, the Company has many controls and programs in place to manage its overall procurement process. The Company recognizes that ESG risks and impacts exist among its suppliers which may differ from the ESG impacts and risks associated with the Company\\u2019s own operations. To better manage these risks, the Company has integrated several - ESG-specific controls and practices into its Master Procurement Process. - Key elements of the procurement process include:\\n\\nMaster Procurement Process - The Company\\u2019s Master Procurement Process is designed to oversee all purchase commitments for production materials and the goods and services that support its worldwide operations. With a mission to deliver the best pricing, quality, supply, technology, and service in a sustainable manner, this model provides a controlled procurement approach that is applied across the organization for commodities and includes the following elements for production and general procurement: - Business awards are reviewed and approved with proper delegation of authority\\n\\nNew Supplier Validation - New suppliers are assessed for numerous capabilities including their operational aspects, financial stability, product security, and ESG expectations. More specifically, all new suppliers are reviewed on the Company\\u2019s sustainability policies, codes of conduct, ISO certifications, ESG standards, environmental impact aspects, controls to prevent forced labor, and public reporting. Of particular concern are suppliers that may be listed as restricted or denied parties identified by governments and/o - r international agencies. The Company\\u2019s policy and formal practice is that under no circumstances shall the Company\\u2019s personnel purchase, sell, or ship any product contrary to applicable export laws or to any individual or firm appearing in any relevant government list of any party who has been denied export or import privileges. During FY 2021/22, 78 companies were assessed using this process. - Contract Management\\n\\nDelegation Authority\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s Code of Conduct includes requirements for the formal delegation which support accountability and responsible procurement practices. The \\u2018Authority to Make Lenovo Commitments\\u2019 section outlines the requirements for delegations with well-defined authority for commitments and other contract terms and conditions and, most importantly, that making business commitments outside these processes is not permitted.\\n\\nSupplier Selection - Supplier relationships are best managed when there are clear stipulations of responsibilities, deliverables, and relevant terms and conditions. The Company\\u2019s supplier contracts incorporate legal and operational agreements and address various types of engagement. Additionally, all production suppliers must comply with the Company\\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct and they are encouraged to comply with the latest version of Responsible Business Alliance\\u2019s (RBA) Code of Conduct. Compliance with the compre - hensive Supplier Code of Conduct is executed via standard purchase agreements or standard purchase orders. The Company\\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as the RBA Code of Conduct, strictly prohibit bribery and corruption. The RBA audit protocol includes anti-bribery and anti-corruption in the Ethics section. - Implementing a controlled approach to awarding the Company\\u2019s business to suppliers is critical to meet its procurement objectives and to establish a trusted base of suppliers. Therefore, even the perception of favoritism or bias is unacceptable. To ensure business awards are conducted ethically and fairly, the Company utilizes defined and approved sourcing methods to ensure the following:\\n\\nSuppliers have a fair opportunity to compete for the Company\\u2019s business - Buyers conduct an ethical evaluation on carefully understood facts such as supplier prices, terms, and conditions\\n\\nInternal Training - The Company recognizes that supply chain management is an ever-changing field. To ensure those with delegated authority are informed on current best practices, it conducts numerous communication and education activities throughout the year for its global supply chain team. Typically, the Company conducts monthly events that feature education opportunities with subject matter experts and provides on-demand targeted training. Beginning in FY 2021/22, the Company has enhanced the education program - by releasing additional online training courses, targeting a 100 percent completion rate. - 83\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni - Procurement Process\\n\\nThe Company is committed to sound ESG management across its end-to-end supply chain process. It has ESG-specific systems in place, supported by contractual requirements to help ensure that suppliers meet or exceed applicable labor, environmental, health and safety, and ethics standards. - (direct and through agencies), employee age requirements, timesheets, pay slips, environmental controls, and other documents. The auditors also conduct individual and group interviews with a random selection of employees (direct and through external agencies). During those interviews the auditors, address freedom of association and collective bargaining among other topics by having conversations with the employees regarding their rights at the facility. - The practices below align with its ESG-related internal corporate policies. The Company\\u2019s human rights commitments are codified through its Human Rights Policy and further explained in its Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. The Company\\u2019s environmental commitments are codified in its Environmental Affairs Policy, Climate and Energy Policy and Water Resiliency Policy. The portions of these commitments that apply to its supply chain extend to suppliers through its Supplier Code of Conduc - t. - The table below provides an overview of the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\u2019 annual RBA audit performance. Because suppliers are encouraged to be audited every two years, each year represents approximately one-half of the suppliers in its audit program for the given year (a total of 56 in the previous FY 2020/21).\\n\\nIn the event of supplier non-conformance to ESG requirements, including those identified by RBA audits, several actions may take place, which include:\\n\\nRBA Leadership and VAP Audits - Immediate discontinuation of business for serious violations\\n\\nThe Company started an effort to require its suppliers to commit to achieving RBA Validated Audit Program (VAP) and Factory of Choice (FOC) designations to demonstrate leadership in ESG.\\n\\nTrack audit findings to closure and required supporting evidence whenever possible\\n\\nPenalize the supplier in the quarterly supplier report card score with a sustainability multiplier\\n\\nSenior procurement management engagement with the supplier - Executive Company management engagement with the supplier - This requires significantly high audit scores, formally trained site personnel, and proof of working grievance systems. In FY 2021/22, 87 percent of the Company\\u2019s suppliers by spend achieved VAP Recognition, and almost 6 percent of the spend was designated Factory of Choice (FOC). By comparison, the numbers were 63 percent and 2 percent respectively in FY 2020/21. It is the Company\\u2019s goal that by 2024, 95 percent of its suppliers by spend will have RBA VAP recognition and 50 percent will have FO - C recognition. - In FY 2021/22, 71 RBA VAP audit reports were completed by the Company\\u2019s suppliers. According to the audit report results, none of the Company\\u2019s suppliers had findings related to the use of child labor or forced labor. - Regardless of their self-assessment risk level, the Company requires 95 percent of suppliers by spend to conduct an RBA VAP audit or an equivalent independent, third-party audit by RBA-approved auditors every two years. During these audits, independent auditors stay for several days at the supplier\\u2019s premises to review employee contracts\\n\\n84\\n\\nHistorical Average Scores\\n\\nLabor Score\\n\\nHealth & Safety Score\\n\\nEnvironmental Score\\n\\nEthics Score\\n\\nManagement Score\\n\\nTotal Score\\n\\n# of Priority findings - # of Major findings\\n\\nSuppliers\\n\\n2017\\n\\n153\\n\\n158\\n\\n181\\n\\n191\\n\\n183\\n\\n143\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n6.3\\n\\n2018\\n\\n156\\n\\n167\\n\\n184\\n\\n191\\n\\n188\\n\\n149\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n157\\n\\n174\\n\\n184\\n\\n197\\n\\n187\\n\\n153\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n157\\n\\n173\\n\\n189\\n\\n199\\n\\n190\\n\\n155\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n5.4\\n\\n2021\\n\\n158\\n\\n180\\n\\n193\\n\\n198\\n\\n196\\n\\n165\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n4.7\\n\\nODM Partners\\n\\n2019\\n\\n156\\n\\n175\\n\\n182\\n\\n197\\n\\n188\\n\\n156\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n5.6\\n\\n2020\\n\\n166\\n\\n188\\n\\n196\\n\\n200\\n\\n197\\n\\n172\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n2021\\n\\n167\\n\\n181\\n\\n197\\n\\n194\\n\\n194\\n\\n170\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n3.9 - Audit Results and Responses\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, 63 suppliers had major labor findings identified in their audits. The most common supplier audit findings are related to an industry-wide problem of excessive working hours and insufficient time off for their employees. While most of this work is done voluntarily by the employees, the Company considers these findings as significant or potentially negative - social impacts. The Company requires its outsourced manufacturers to report their employees\\u2019 working hours and time off performance monthly via an online tool so that it can take action to resolve any issues that are identified. Because agreements for improvement were reached with suppliers with significant or potentially negative social impacts, no relationships were terminated as a result of the labor findings. The FY 2021/22 results are shown below.\\n\\n14% Conformance\\n\\n14% Major\\n\\n19% Major - Excessive Working Hours\\n\\n67% Minor\\n\\n10% Minor\\n\\nInsufficient Time off\\n\\n76% Conformance\\n\\n85\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nJoint Audits with Company\\u2019s PCSD Quality Team - Child Labor\\n\\nBesides running the Company\\u2019s formal RBA Program, the Global Supply Chain Team also collaborates with the Company\\u2019s PCs and Smart Devices (PCSD) Quality Team to conduct on-site audits in suppliers\\u2019 facilities. With assistance from the Quality Team, the Company is building a new way to emphasize the importance of monitoring its suppliers. - The new joint program was launched in October 2021. In total, 81 PCSD Quality Engineers have been trained by the Company\\u2019s RBA professionals and have engaged in 80 supplier audits. These audits focus on Labor, Health and Safety. The Company\\u2019s Quality Team leads the audit by using pre-designed questionnaires and checklists developed by the ESG Team in accordance with the RBA standard. - The Company supports universal human rights including those identified in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Company commits to extending these rights to its employees and others directly or indirectly employed in its supply chain. Child labor is not to be used in any stage of business operations. The term \\u201cchild\\u201d refers to any person under the age of 15, under the age for com - pleting compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is the highest. To ensure the human rights noted above, the Company implemented multiple guidelines and actions including, but not limited to: - Human Rights Policy\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nEmployee Code of Conduct\\n\\nForced Labor\\n\\nSupplier Code of Conduct - Source Right 6.1\\n\\nThe Company is committed to eradicating forced labor in all its forms including slavery and human trafficking at every stage of business operations. It holds a firm position that there is zero tolerance for forced labor and any documented instances will be met with immediate action, including discontinuing the business relationship with any suppliers that overlook this practice.\\n\\nDue diligence and audits across the supply chain to identify risks in child labor violations - Mandatory education and certification on labor topics for buyers\\n\\nTo better detect and mitigate the forced labor risks, the Company adopts and implements preventive measures. In FY 2021/22, some of the Company\\u2019s actions to prevent this practice were:\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, there were no violations reported related to child labor at the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\u2019 RBA VAP audits. - Living Wages\\n\\nUpdated version of the Supplier Code of Conduct enhancing the management of labor agents and contractors\\n\\nUpdated version of the Procurement Source Right Code 6.1, improved with new supplier validation process\\n\\nMandatory education and certification on forced labor prevention for a total of 325 sourcing managers from all global business groups - Through the RBA audit and corrective action process, the Company drives suppliers to adhere to applicable wage and benefit laws and regulations. In FY 2021/22, the Company decided to move a step forward to extend the responsibility from the worker\\u2019s individual wellbeing to an employee\\u2019s family. The Company is participating in the RBA Living Wage work group and is exploring the development of implementation guidelines to support workers throughout the supply chain. The ultimate target of the Livi - ng Wage project team is to publish a Living Wage policy, to deliver training, and verify the baseline within its business in 2022. - A third-party ESG risk assessment tool (EcoVadis) launched to screen suppliers throughout the supply chain tiers\\n\\nQuarterly discussions with suppliers on potential red flags related to forced labor\\n\\nRegular RBA Responsible Labor Initiative/VAP workgroup engagements\\n\\n86\\n\\nEcoVadis - Responsible Sourcing of Materials\\n\\nThe Company is continuously increasing focus on sustainability in procurement. In FY 2021/22, it began to strategically expand the scope of ESG assessments to suppliers across all categories by launching the EcoVadis tools. - The EcoVadis platform aims to provide ESG ratings for a large base of suppliers, including production procurement, general procurement, and other key suppliers. The Company has implemented the EcoVadis IQ tool to screen suppliers\\u2019 ESG risk, based on their inherent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) risks and procurement information. In FY 2021/22, more than 457 suppliers were processed in the EcoVadis IQ tool, and 110 suppliers were invited to conduct an EcoVadis ESG assessment. - The Company recognizes the importance of the responsible procurement of raw materials when sourced from regions experiencing political and social conflict, which may include the conflict minerals of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or surrounding countries. Since 2012, the Company has adhered to the following efforts and expects its production procurement and ODM suppliers to do the same: - The Company continues to ensure that all strategically important suppliers participate in the EcoVadis program and achieve at least 45 of 100 points or a comparable audit result. Suppliers scoring less than 45 out of 100 points must implement a corrective action plan (CAP) and the progress will be tracked within 90 days. - The 360 Watch feature of the EcoVadis platform is another monitoring measure taken to minimize the risk of child and forced labor, or any other social, environmental, and governance risks. Negative media coverage in these areas related to a supplier will be highlighted to the Company\\u2019s management, requiring the supplier to respond within one week, and develop a corrective action plan. The 360 Watch, in addition to other indicators, enables the Company to monitor and score its suppliers on variou - s ESG focus areas, helping it to continually improve the supply base. - The intentions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \\u2018Dodd-Frank 1502 Rule\\u2019 even if not directly regulated by the U.S. SEC\\n\\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Sourcing Materials from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas\\n\\nRBA Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) program - The Company supports the efforts of the RMI to address materials beyond 3TG. In FY 2021/22, the Company conducted extensive due diligence for the Company\\u2019s cobalt supply chain using the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) and the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The Company will coordinate with the RMI as RMI performs risk profiles on other materials, assess the content in its products, and further develop due diligence efforts to mitigate supply chain risk. These efforts were init - iated through RMI\\u2019s coordination with the \\u2018Drive Sustainability\\u2019 organization which has already developed risk profiles on over 30 materials in the technology and automotive industry.

These disclosures pertain to production procurement and ODM suppliers. - and requires both RBA priority and major findings to be tracked to closure. None of the RBA audits for the reporting period contained priority environmental findings; therefore, the Company did not terminate any supplier relationships in response to significant potential or actual negative environmental impacts.\\n\\nEnvironmental Impacts in the Supply Chain - The Company\\u2019s corporate-wide environmental standards and specifications require its product designers to consider environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimization of resource consumption. The Company\\u2019s priority is for its suppliers to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. Compliance to the standards and specifications is monitored as part of the Product Compliance Review Board Process. - Annually, the Company requests key suppliers to formally report environmental data related to climate change, water and waste. The Company asks that suppliers report via the Responsible Business Alliance or the CDP reporting methodologies in addition to responding to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE). Last year, the Company introduced the IPE tool to its suppliers. IPE provides a free tool to help Tier 1 suppliers assess environmental compliance in their supply chain, exten - ding the Company\\u2019s governance to up-stream suppliers. - Environmental Audit Results and Responses\\n\\nDuring the FY 2021/22 reporting period, 71 of the Company\\u2019s suppliers, representing over 50 percent of its total procurement spend, underwent RBA facility-level audits. Over the period of FY 2020/21 and FY 2021/22, 129 suppliers underwent RBA facility-level audits, which represent 95% of the suppliers by spend. The Company considers RBA priority findings to be indicative of significant impacts\\n\\nESG KPI: By FY 2025/26, we will remove\\n\\n1 million - metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain*\\n\\nRelative to FY 2018/19 measured emissions\\n\\n88\\n\\nRecognitions - The Company has once again been named in the Gartner Global Supply Chain Top 25 listing for 2022.

The Company\\u2019s target in this area is to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 25 percent per million US$ procurement spend by FY 2029/30, compared to FY 2018/19. Based on FY 2021/22 data, the Company is on track reducing the GHG emissions from purchased goods and services. - In FY 2021/22, the Company\\u2019s procurement team began adding an ESG standard template into its quarterly business review (QBR) with suppliers to maintain ESG as a topic of discussion\\n\\nWater\\n\\nThe Company surveys key suppliers on water-related data including performance indicators such as annual water withdrawal, water discharge, and water recycle/ reuse volumes.\\n\\nScope 3 GHG Emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (MT/per million US$ procurement spend) - Baseline (FY 2018/19)\\n\\nFY 2021/22\\n\\nTarget (FY 2029/30)\\n\\n79\\n\\n73\\n\\n59 - For the most recent supplier data collection period, the Company\\u2019s coverage of engagement was 92 percent of procurement spend. Since one of the most straightforward indicators of impact (especially to water-stressed areas) is water withdrawal, the Company has been encouraging suppliers to set up water reduction targets since 2014. During the last data collection period, 76 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with quantified water reduction goals. - Science Based Targets for Suppliers\\n\\nIn addition to setting Science Based Targets (SBT\\u2019s), the Company has been working to promote the concept of a low carbon transition with production procurement and ODM suppliers. The Company is engaging and incentivizing these suppliers to also commit to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). - Waste\\n\\nThe waste-related information collected from suppliers includes data such as annual hazardous and nonhazardous waste volumes.\\n\\nDuring the reporting period, 28 percent of its procurement spend included suppliers with formally recognized SBT\\u2019s which was an increase of 4 percent from the previous year. It is the Company\\u2019s goal to achieve 95 percent of procurement spend with suppliers that implement SBT\\u2019s. - Waste prevention is the most preferable option in the waste management hierarchy, and the Company encourages suppliers to set up public waste reduction targets. During the last data collection period, 83 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with quantified waste reduction goals.\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN DIVERSITY - Capability Building\\n\\nMany of the Company\\u2019s suppliers are large national and international suppliers. They manage their corporate ESG programs while engaging directly with the Company\\u2019s programs. In addition to its own training programs, the Company offers and provides the following: - The Company\\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program is committed to seeking and developing diverse businesses while contributing to the economic success of communities it serves. It recognizes that supplier diversity creates a win-win by influencing the inclusion of diverse businesses within its supply base which impacts brand reputation management and improves revenue performance through sales.\\n\\n90 - In FY 2021/22, the Company\\u2019s total U.S. spend across all business units with small and/or diverse suppliers accounted for 23 percent of its total expenditure in the U.S.\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, the Company also exceeded the U.S. Government Small Business Subcontract Plan target of 12 percent by achieving 16 percent of U.S. spend with small businesses over the course of the Fiscal Year. - The Company continues to partner with several non-government organizations (NGO) such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women\\u2019s Business Enterprise Networking Council (WBENC). The Company also increased support to minority businesses through the \\u201cEvolve Small\\u201d program, in collaboration with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and Toronto Regional Board of Trade. Through this initiative, the Company helped small businesses recover from the impact of CO - VID-19 by providing sixty companies in seven different markets across the United States and Canada ongoing support throughout the year. - The GSC Risk Council established a monthly collaborative platform to engage the business unit functions, leverage insight and identify synergies as the Company addresses risk management decisions. The convergence of business function leaders provides the opportunity to evaluate the impacts on the other functions and develop a consolidated business continuity plan with clear actions. - Effective risk management strategies have been a critical part of driving business performance. The Company has also recognized opportunities are created when it transforms risks into opportunities that can support its long-term growth. The Risk Council recently directed a scenario planning exercise that included identifying potential risks from the following categories:\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 - Strategy Financial Catastrophic events Human Capital Legal and Regulatory Compliance Operations Sociopolitical\\n\\nAs the Company moves forward, its success not only lies within workforce diversity but also in the inclusion of diverse suppliers that provide competitive advantages, increased innovation, and revenue that can support its brand reputation.\\n\\nBuilding Supply Chain Resilience - In 2021, the Company established the GSC Risk Council to support risk management throughout its supply chain. The GSC Risk Council\\u2019s mission is to boost the Company\\u2019s growth by implementing risk controls through industry-proven processes that can enable the supply chain to quickly adapt to demands for new technology and reduce the risk associated with the transition. Agility and resilience are critical components for a successful GSC strategy than can withstand the short lifecycle of information - and communications technology products and changing consumer demands. - After analyzing these categories, the strategy team selected the top five risks for the fiscal year. With consideration of the organization\\u2019s risk appetite and the business-driven data that was collected, the team selected the top five potential risks and conducted a comprehensive scenario planning for each risk. For each scenario, the team incorporated stakeholder feedback, identified contributing factors, and analyzed both short-term and long-term impacts. - The information derived from this planning exercise enabled the GSC Risk Council to understand the types of risks that may impact the Company and how those conditions may affect its performance, thus contributing to the development of greater strategy resilience and flexibility throughout the supply chain.\\n\\nThe GSC Risk Council\\u2019s main objectives include the oversight of:\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 -

Data excludes:\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nConsultants and vendors working through a contract agency or third-party performing services or consulting on site for a brief time and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n\\u2013 - Contractors who usually perform non-critical, non-core jobs and their employment decisions, including pay and benefits, are made by the third-party employer \\u2013 and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nSupplemental students who are interns or who are hired for a very short window of time and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n4 - Turnover rate data covers voluntary departure of regular employees for the full FY 2021/22. Involuntary turnover is planned exit of employees which is in alignment with the company strategy and decisions. Hence, as a strategic and standard practice, this is excluded from reporting.\\n\\n5\\n\\nIn FY 2020/21, turnover rates by region were transposed among AP, China and EMEA. Totals did not change but were realigned with the corresponding region.\\n\\n6 - Metrics based on FY beginning with FY 2018/19. Results were not revised.\\n\\n7\\n\\nLenovo\\u2019s total contributions in responding to natural disasters is US$8,128,720.76. This amount is tracked at the geo level. In prior reporting periods, the Company reported a separate line item for global disaster response. Beginning with FY 2021/22, the disaster response total will be integrated into the respective geographic contributions.\\n\\n8 - Increase in China giving reflects tracking of Lenovo Foundation Beijing and a US$7.8M donation in response to the Henan floods.\\n\\n9\\n\\nTotal giving in Latin America reflects tracking of the Motorola Brazil tax incentive program.\\n\\n10\\n\\nTotal contribution in Asia Pacific includes Lenovo\\u2019s commitment to the India Companies Act.\\n\\n11\\n\\nEstimated value of employee volunteer hours is calculated based off an entry level hourly wage of US$43 per hour.\\n\\n12 - Employee giving represents the corporate match from Lenovo for employees around the world, which increased in FY 2021/22 with the launch of the new Benevity platform.\\n\\n13\\n\\nTotal contribution to communities for FY 2019/20 and FY 2020/21 was defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations. In FY 2021/22 it is defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations together with Lenovo's match of global employee donations.\\n\\n14 - Product transportation emissions include key upstream suppliers representing majority of global logistics spend. Note: Upon looking into GHG Protocol standard, we decided to re-categorize this to upstream from downstream transportation (from FY 2016/17, previous years were adjusted accordingly).\\n\\n15 - The Company is in the process of improving input data for this Scope 3 category. The data reported here is the best available estimate at the time of publication. In the FY 2022/23 ESG Report, data will be restated if needed to reflect any improved input data.\\n\\n16\\n\\nEmissions from waste include nonhazardous waste, hazardous waste and wastewater from all manufacturing, R&D locations and some large offices. No product waste is included.\\n\\n17 - Purchased goods and services include suppliers covering 94% of direct global suppliers spend. The RBA Carbon and Water Reporting Tool was used for collection of supplier data. Individual supplier data is from each supplier\\u2019s most recent reporting period and not reflective of Lenovo\\u2019s FY 2021/22. Data was allocated based on revenue.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe value for FY 2018/19 is being restated to correct an error that appeared in the FY 2020/21 ESG Report.\\n\\n19 - Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include transmission & distribution (T&D) losses from Lenovo\\u2019s worldwide purchased electricity and natural gas. A World Bank database and Energy Star Performance Rating document were used for determining T&D loss rates.\\n\\n20 - Lenovo used the current Product Attribute Impact Algorithm (PAIA) notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server tool for calculating emissions of Lenovo\\u2019s typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server. The calculated results show emissions distribution by different parts and also for use, packaging, transportation, and end-of-life treatment categories. The emissions associated with use and end-of-life treatment of sold products were estim - ated on a \\u201cnarrow\\u201d baseline for the typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server multiplied by sold/shipped product volumes. - 21\\n\\nEmissions from capital goods are based on purchased capital goods in a given year. The 2012 Guidelines to Defra GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Annex 13 was used for emission factors for different type of capital goods adjusted for inflation rate and exchange rate.\\n\\n108\\n\\n22\\n\\nApproximately less than 1% of purchased energy (electricity) is estimated based upon energy use at similar Lenovo facilities with metered usage.\\n\\n23 - When totals are slightly different than the exact sum of individual numbers it is due to rounding.\\n\\n24\\n\\nBrazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, United States, Chinese mainland, Taiwan, China represent manufacturing and R&D sites in these markets. \\u201cRest of World\\u201d represents all sites managed by Lenovo\\u2019s Real Estate organization (non-manufacturing) across the world (small and large \\u2014 except the ones in regions listed above).\\n\\n25 - Renewable energy generation capacity includes electric solar panels in Hefei and Wuhan, China and Morrisville and Whitsett, NC, USA and Ullo, Hungary.\\n\\n26 - For FY 2021/22, All Areas includes all the Company\\u2019s manufacturing, research & development, and large office sites (>100 employees). In earlier FYs, some research and development and large office locations were excluded while the Company worked to increase data coverage. Small offices (<100 employees) and retail locations are always excluded from the water reporting requirements, but a few small offices voluntarily report and are included.\\n\\n27 - All water withdrawals are estimated to be freshwater withdrawals. Due to our reliance on third-parties for the vast majority of the Company\\u2019s water withdrawals, it is not possible to determine the exact parameters of all sources, but it is reasonable to assume the majority of the sources had low TDS based on local knowledge and communication with third-parties.\\n\\n28 - Areas with water stress are areas with high or extremely high baseline water stress according to World Resources Institute\\u2019s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Values reported for areas with water stress are a subset of values reported for all areas.\\n\\n29 - Third-party withdrawal by source was collected for all the Company\\u2019s environmentally significant sites (which are the Company\\u2019s ISO14001 certified locations). In FY 2021/22, these locations comprised approximately 82% of the Company\\u2019s withdrawal from water stressed areas. The remaining 18% are primarily from office locations that often require less water and operate as part of a larger office complex where they may not be directly billed by the third-party responsible for withdrawals.\\n\\n30 - For more information on the wastewater exceedance that occurred in FY 2021/22, see page 25.\\n\\n31\\n\\nWater intensity metrics are based on the Company\\u2019s total global headcount which includes the headcount of the excluded locations mentioned in Note 26.\\n\\n32\\n\\nWaste data includes site waste from most manufacturing, processes and operations, research & development sites, and large offices. Waste from products is reported separately.\\n\\n33 - E-waste generated at the Company\\u2019s sites is also included in PELM data.\\n\\n34\\n\\nBatteries collected at Lenovo\\u2019s sites are also included in the PELM data.\\n\\n35\\n\\nThe Company does not operate any onsite recovery operations; all wastes are seperated onsite to be collected by third-parties for recovery offsite.\\n\\n36\\n\\nRecycling includes some composting of nonhazardous, organic wastes.\\n\\n37\\n\\nAll hazardous waste diverted for recovery was diverted for recycling.\\n\\n38 - The Company does not operate any onsite disposal operations; all wastes are seperated onsite to be collected by third-parties for disposal offsite.\\n\\n39 - Lenovo\\u2019s Product End-of-Life Management (PELM) and Product Take Back (PTB) includes materials from customers and Lenovo-owned country returns, manufacturing and R&D scrap, and employee equipment from real estate sites. These metrics represent all data received from PELM suppliers as of the time of publication of this report. Not all data was available at the time of publication, so actual volumes may be higher.\\n\\n40 - These metrics represent all data received from recycled plastics suppliers at the time of publication.\\n\\n41\\n\\nThe CY2021 decrease in percent of notebooks can be attributed to an expanded line of gaming system notebooks that either could not meet the Energy Star requirements or Lenovo decided not to register.\\n\\n42\\n\\nThe CY2021 decrease in percent of monitors was associated with an expanded line of low cost, entry-level consumer displays.\\n\\n43 - Estimated using the average packaging weight per unit and total shipping volumes for the following categories of products: notebooks, desktops, servers, workstations, monitors, smartphones, tablets, and accessories.\\n\\n44\\n\\nThe value for FY 2020/21 is being restated to reflect improved shipping volumes for accessories.\\n\\n109\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl -

Nonetheless, emissions and its effects on the globe\\u2019s temperature and air quality are multi-generational challenges that our society must and will continue to address in the long term. - One of the key drivers in\\n\\nestablishing Dynagas was to become part of and develop with the LNG transportation industry in order to contribute to lowering global emissions. Natural gas, when combusted, is the lowest emitting fossil fuel. Compared to oil, the combustion of natural gas reduces CO2 emissions by 25% and reduces 95% of NOX emissions, while nearly 100% of SOx and particulars emissions are eliminated. - We believe that natural gas is one of the few available, scalable, environmentally and financially sustainable contributors to lower global emissions today and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The efficiency, flexibility and responsiveness of the combined cycle gas powerplant makes natural gas a very important baseload provider of energy that can be complemented with renewable providers such as wind and solar, whose output is variable and dependent on factors beyond human control. - We consider it noteworthy to mention that up to the moment of the energy crisis, there was a desire by policy makers to drive up fossil fuel prices (through emission taxes, reduction of new investments in fossil fuel projects etc) in order to curb fossil demand. Today, after a period of protracted under-investment in oil and gas infrastructure, high energy prices are sending the global economy into recession. Following recent events, we can conclude that our society is not yet equipped to depart - from an available and on demand energy infrastructure primarily based on fossil fuels as - long as a workable alternative is not in place. Clearly, the change into renewable technologies is a long transition and not a switch, which will require significant technological developments, careful implementation, creative solutions and an approach that prioritizes prosperity and justice. The recent turmoil in the global energy markets has been an important reminder of this inescapable fact. - In order to make a difference to the environment, the key is to develop and improve as an industry. The shipping industry and in particular the LNG shipping industry has in fact improved its carbon footprint per unit transported dramatically during the last 15 years. The main reasons for these improvements are new developments in technology in terms of cargo containment systems, re-liquefaction systems, communications, weather routing systems, and of course propulsion systems. Even in the absenc - e of any regulatory requirements the LNG shipping and equipment industry have been responsible by continuing to develop new technological solutions. - Apart from a desire to improve the vessels emissions profile, shipowners are incentivised to contribute to continuous improvement and reduction of emissions because a reduction in fuel consumption (which yields emissions savings) also reduces the cost per unit transported and improves the vessel\\u2019s financial performance.\\n\\nThe LNG shipping industry and Dynagas have and will continue to innovate and remain focused on - lowering emissions in a sustainable manner as the path towards decarbonization becomes clearer. We recognize the importance of climate change and the need to develop sustainable solutions and we are committed in embedding the ESG factor in our business model. - Our main target in compiling this ESG report is to meet the expectations of our stakeholders considering the impact they have to our business. We are committed to operate in a socially responsible manner ensuring the safety of our people and the environment, through a transparent and an ethical behaviour. The social and governance component of ESG is of paramount importance for us, as social purpose-led goals are woven into our company\\u2019s culture. The health, well-being and development of our cre - w and employees remains our top priority as we continue to build on an already successful track record. - Despite the continuous innovation and considerable selection of modern and fuel-efficient propulsion systems, the 2050 IMO global strategy and objective brings us to the need to work with the industry to find ways of continuing to reduce the environmental footprint. - The effective management of Environmental, Social and Governance matters are fundamental and of key strategic importance to Dynagas LNG Partners LP, as we work together to develop long term sustainable practices and create value to our shareholders, business, our employees, customers, investors and the community.\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n1.

SUSTAINABILITY AT DYNAGAS - The LNG Supply Chain\\n\\nLNG is transported through sea in purpose-built tanks on double-hulled ships to a receiving terminal, where it is unloaded and stored in heavily insulated tanks. The LNG is then returned to its gaseous state, or regasified, in regasification facilities at the receiving terminal. Finally, the regasified LNG is moved through pipeline for distribution to natural gas customers.\\n\\nLNG\\n\\n3.

ENVIRONMENT: CLIMATE IMPACT AND EMISSIONS\\n\\nStrict environmental regulations put further pressure on the shipping industry towards decarbonization.\\n\\n2018 - The International Maritime Organization (IMO), adopted an initial strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping, targeting to reduce the total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050 and the CO2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards a reduction of 70% by 2050 (in comparison to 2008 levels).\\n\\n2019 - The European Commission published the Green Deal, which is a package of policy initiatives, to assist EU on the path to a green transition, with the aim of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 including a target to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050 over the baseline level of the year 1990.\\n\\n2020 - The IMO adopted amendments to the MARPOL convention that require ships to combine technical - Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) - and operational - Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) - measures to reduce their carbon intensity gradually by 2% annually from 2023 through 2026. - The European Commission published \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d package, targeting a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d includes four proposals which are directly related to the shipping industry, more specifically to the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the set of a maximum limit on the GHG intensity of energy used on board by a ship (FuelEU Maritime Initiative), the introduction of a minimum tax rate on the relevant fuels used for intra-EU ferr - y, fishing and freight vessels (Energy Taxation Directive) and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation to ensure that the decarbonization pathway of the transport fleet is supported by adequate recharging and refueling infrastructure in EU ports. - LNG is considered to be the cleanest fossil fuel and a \\u201cbridge fuel\\u201d in the context of the energy transition. Global shipping is turning towards the selection of LNG as a fuel towards decarbonization. The combustion of LNG fuel emits lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than coal or oil, as well as lower nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and almost no environmentally-damaging Sulphur Oxides (SOx) emissions.\\n\\nWe are committed to meet industry\\u2019s targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\\n\\n18 - 19\\n\\n5.

In order to comply with the said regulation vessels should: (i) use 0.5% sulphur fuels on board, (ii) instal scrubbers (Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems - ESGSs) for cleaning of the exhaust gases of the vessels, and (iii) retrofit vessels to be powered by liquefied natural gas. Entry into force: January 1, 2020. - Our response\\n\\nThe use of LNG as fuel is promoted as one of the most effective compliance means. All of our vessels can operate with low-sulphur fuels.\\n\\nInventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM)\\n\\nZERO\\n\\nnon-compliance with environmental laws and regulations incidents in 2021 - Regulation aiming to ensure that ships, being recycled once they reach the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health and safety Vessels of 500 gross tonnage or above, regardless of flag, will require a certified IHM on board if calling at an EU port or anchorage. Non-EU flagged vessels may also be certified against EU SRR by complying with the HKC IHM requirements. Entered into force: December 31, 2020. - Our response\\n\\nAll of our vessels hold an approved IHM certificate and Statement of Compliance. Relevant training is offered ashore and onboard.\\n\\nIEnergy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) - Amendments to MARPOL Convention introduced requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping. The requirements include a technical approach to reduce carbon intensity based on the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) which measures the theoretical energy efficiency of ships. The attained EEXI is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and a - bove.

Reciprocally, to reduce the production of waste on board the ship on all voyages, it is required the packaging of all supplied stores, provisions and spares to be environmentally friendly, recyclable and to be kept to a safe minimum. - Since 2001, the IMO has adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, or the \\u201cAnti-fouling Convention\\u201d. The Convention entered into force on September 17, 2008 and prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of molluscs and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. - The supply of stores in bulk (i.e. lub oils) further reduces the number of drums, wastes, etc., in this respect all relevant departments pass relevant instructions to suppliers and Master and report their responses.\\n\\nWe have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti- fouling Convention. - The waste quantities produced in 2021 by each of our LNG carriers (on board) per month in presented in the Table below.

Describe your business model (including business object, products/services) . WUQM Consulting GmbH is a management consultancy based in W\\u00fcrzburg, Germany. Since 1994, we have been advising and supporting companies and organizations in the implementation, monitoring and verification, maintenance and continuous further development of process-oriented (integrated) management systems or operational processes (measurement, monitoring and audit activities) in particular in the following areas: You can find more details on our consulting topics and services here. In addition, we offer a wide range of training courses, specialist seminars and thematic in-house training to strengthen legal certainty in companies and to develop professional competencies. . Occupational Safety and Health Protection; Data Protection and Information Security; Energy Management, Energy and Resource Efficiency; Sustainability Management, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Quality Management; Food Safety; Risk Management and Product Safety; Environmental Management and EMASeasyTM Methodology . Additional remarks: . WUQM Consulting not only offers its customers the opportunity to take a role model on the way to a more sustainable business way by supporting them, for example, in the introduction of integrated management systems, but also sets a good example. As a micro-enterprise, WUQM is not obliged to report on its sustainability commitment in the sense of the CSR Directive Implementation Act, but takes sustainability reporting as an opportunity and voluntarily reports. In 2015, WUQM Consulting introduced the integrated management system EMASplus. In autumn 2015, an external expert confirmed the standard conformity of WUQM Consulting with the EMAS Regulation and EMASplus. The registration certificate was handed over to the company by the IHK W\\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt in spring 2016. WUQM Consulting's commitment to sustainability also includes the signing of the sustainability code of the event industry, which is a fair obligation for the organisation of its own events and seminars. Since 2017, WUQM Consulting has also been an official DNK training partner and contributes to the German sustainability code's promotion of sustainable business through the provision of information events and training courses. For more details, please refer to our sustainability report with an integrated 2015 environmental statement and our updated 2017 environmental statement. . 1. Strategic analysis and measures . The company discloses whether it pursues a sustainability strategy and explains what concrete measures it is taking to operate in accordance with the essential and recognised industry-specific, national and international standards. . In 2015, WUQM Consulting applied the process-oriented methodology Ecomapping\\u00ae and EMASeasyTM and introduced the integrated sustainability management system EMASplus to meet the standards of the EMAS Regulation, the EMASplus Directive, ISO 14001 and ISO 26000. Important elements of this methodology are the analysis of the essential social, environmental and economic aspects of business practices, their opportunities and risks, as well as the development of a program with defined measures, responsibilities and objectives based on an FLIPO matrix with integrated sustainability assessment of the individual activities of the company. To complement the FLIPO matrix, WUQM Consulting's team also carried out a SWOT analysis, which identifies strengths and weaknesses for the company's future viability. Derivation of appropriate measures is currently in progress. A more detailed description of the methodology and the individual analysis steps can be found in the Sustainability Report with an integrated Environmental Statement 2015 and in the updated Environmental Statement 2017. . 2. Materiality . The company discloses which aspects of its own business activities have a significant impact on aspects of sustainability and the significant impact the aspects of sustainability have on its business activities. It analyses the positive and negative effects and indicates how these findings are incorporated into its own processes. . WUQM Consulting sees itself as a pioneer for sustainable business \\u2013 on the one hand through its advisory services to companies and organizations, and on the other hand through its assumption of responsibility for the social impact of its own business activities. Therefore, a key sustainability aspect is the consistent alignment of decisions with the corporate guidelines and the definition of concrete annual targets. The latter are stated in the 2016-2018 improvement programme (see updated Environmental Statement 2017, pp. 9-14). The improvement programme lists the measures implemented and planned for the sustainability aspects identified as relevant in the FLIPO matrix: 1) Positioning of WUQM Consulting as a pioneer and model for other companies and organisations 2) Promoting employee motivation and satisfaction 3) Promoting customer satisfaction 4) Environmentally friendly design of events 5) Establishment of an environmentally friendly mobility behaviour 6) Establishment of an environmentally friendly and fair procurement 7) Promotion of employee health 8) Establishment of transparent and environmentally friendly waste management In accordance with the company guidelines, WUQM Consulting strives to promote environmentally friendly and socially appropriate action in order to strengthen the sustainability of companies and organizations. In order to implement this claim in its own company, WUQM Consulting always takes into account its impact on the environment and society in its decisions and business practices. The company supports sustainable value creation in the region by preferably cooperating with local suppliers, service providers and organizations. By exchanging and actively engaging in regional, nationwide and international projects, networks and cooperations, the existing competencies are optimally introduced and expanded. This principle also applies to its own employees, whose motivation and satisfaction is increased, for example, by the targeted promotion of their strengths. The basis for this is a cooperation based on honesty and trust. . Objectives . The company discloses which qualitative and/or quantitative as well as time-defined sustainability goals are set and operationalized and how their level of achievement is controlled. . WUQM Consulting has defined goals in its 2016-2018 improvement programme (see updated Environmental Statement 2017, pp. 9-14) as part of the EMASplus integrated management system for each sustainability aspect and assigned them to achieve targets. An annual update is carried out, which guarantees a continuous optimization process involving all employees. The monitoring is carried out by the sustainability officers (internal audits, continuation of improvement program, team meetings, reporting) and the management (management review). Environmental indicators for reviewing the achievement of targets are analysed in an input-output analysis ( Electricity and heat, mobility, material consumption, energy consumption, water and wastewater, waste, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants) were recorded. By means of an environmental verifier (external audit), WUQM Consulting was officially confirmed by the EMAS Regulation (integrated into ISO 14001) and the EMASplus Directive (integrated into ISO 26000) at the end of 2015 and the corresponding certificates or certificates were handed over by the IHK W\\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt. Details on the quantitative and qualitative objectives, the state of implementation of the measures as well as the input-output analysis can be read in the Sustainability Report with integrated environmental declaration 2015 and in the updated environmental declaration 2017. . 4. Depth of the value chain . The company specifies the importance of sustainability aspects for value creation and to what depth of its value chain sustainability criteria are reviewed. . WUQM Consulting provides its value creation mainly in consulting or through training courses in the areas of energy, environmental and sustainability management as well as occupational and health protection. The company offers customers throughout Germany, but primarily within a radius of 200km from its own location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The resulting frequent travel activities have a high environmental relevance. To minimize the negative environmental impacts through mobility, the preferred means of transport is the railway. The employees are provided with the BahnCard 50 for this purpose. If it is not possible to travel by train, reasonable carpoolings will be formed. Two e-charging stations were installed on the company's parking spaces and a plug-in hybrid vehicle leased for the management in December 2016. Furthermore, the possibility of leasing e-bikes, the reimbursement of costs for public transport and the development of a business travel policy is planned for 2017. Another important point for the added value of WUQM Consulting is the provision of information and training events. By moving to new office rooms on the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areal (the buildings under the protection of monuments have been built according to current EnEV- Since autumn 2015, WUQM Consulting has been providing its own seminar room. The events are conducted in accordance with the sustainability code in a fair manner. Most of the materials are digitally made available to participants on USB stick to save resources. If this is not possible, WUQM Consulting will only use recycled paper (Blauer Engel) to print the materials. In addition, an expansion of the event portfolio to include digital offers is planned for the future. For internal office supplies, a procurement policy sets environmentally friendly and fair standards for the purchase of office equipment, IT-based equipment and equipment. Equipment and food pre-orders are ordered almost exclusively from environmentally certified partners (shippers, printing companies, etc.). WUQM Consulting is very strongly involved in regional networks for the exchange of experience, the establishment of best practice examples and the use of synergy effects to promote the regional business location Mainfranken (supporting the environment Unterfranken e.V., advisory network Mainfranken, model Hohenlohe, BVMW Mainfranken, energy efficiency initiative Unterfranken, etc.). . 5. Responsibility . The responsibilities in corporate management for sustainability are disclosed. . The overall responsibility for the management system lies with the management board, Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig and Dr. Michael Zoller. The sustainability officer, Tina Heinemann, was qualified and appointed for the introduction, maintenance and further development of the integrated management system. The managing director Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig is a specialist for occupational safety (SiFa) and is responsible for risk assessments, instruction, ergonomics at the workplace and all questions relating to occupational and health protection in the office and field service. The second managing director Dr. Michael Zoller is responsible for the implementation of internal data protection. Legally, WUQM Consutling is not obliged to appoint a data protection officer, but the company benefits from these additional qualifications. . 6. Rules and processes . The company discloses how the sustainability strategy is implemented through rules and processes in the operational business. . In order to implement the defined business guidelines, the integrated management system EMASplus was introduced. This ensures the continuous improvement process of WUQM Consulting towards a sustainable economy. The individual tasks and responsibilities in the management system are documented in an internal responsibility matrix. The entire team of WUQM Consulting is actively involved in the implementation, further development and maintenance of the integrated management system. This is done through processes such as the Ecomapping\\u00ae methodology, the identification and evaluation of the relevant sustainability aspects in the FLIPO matrix, the development and continuation of the improvement program with defined responsibilities, the proposal for measures and the implementation of internal audits. In the operational business, sustainable practices are defined e.g. by the following guidelines and the signing of codes: . Directive on eco-fair procurement for office materials, IT products, cleaning products and occupational clothing, electricity supply, heat supply through biogas, food and beverages, and event management (introduced 01/2016).; Business Travel Directive for the promotion of public transport/rail transport and e-mobility (Hybrid vehicles, e-bikes) (planned until 07/2017).; Sustainability Code Fair Obligation of the Event Management (signed 07/2015) ; Training Partner of the German Sustainability Code: WUQM Consulting has been offering consulting services in the areas of sustainable management, environmental and quality management, energy and resource efficiency, risk management and the qualification of managers and employees for more than 20 years. Since 02/2017 WUQM Consulting has been supporting companies and public institutions through training on the application of the DNK. . 7. Control . The company discloses how and which performance indicators are used for sustainability in regular internal planning and control. It explains how appropriate processes ensure reliability, comparability and consistency of data for internal control and external communication. . With the introduction of the integrated management system EMASplus, an input-output analysis on the data base of 2014 was prepared for the first time. In the updated environmental statement 2017 the key figures of 2014, 2015 and 2016 are shown. However, comparability and use of the data for internal control is not possible so far, as WUQM Consulting changed its location in 2015. Currently, especially environmental key figures are collected. The balance sheet is to be extended over the years by sustainability indicators from the social and economic area. About the sustainability report with integrated environmental statement 2015 and the updated environmental statement 2017 the sustainability commitment of WUQM Consulting is presented externally transparent, credible and comprehensible. . Performance indicators for criteria 5 to 7 . Performance Indicator G4-56 Describe the values, principles and standards of conduct and conduct (codes of conduct and ethics) of the organization. . Corporate Guidelines; Sustainability Code Fair Obligations of the Event Industry; Eco-fair Procurement Directive; Business Travel Directive to promote the use of public transport/rail transport and e-mobility (in planning); Registration as a certified company according to EMAS and EMASplus . Incentive schemes . The company discloses how the target agreements and remuneration for managers and employees are also oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and long-term value creation. It is disclosed to what extent the achievement of these goals is part of the evaluation of the top management level (CEO/CEO) by the supervisory board. . In half-yearly employee discussions with the management, individual goals are defined and evaluated, how the employee can optimally participate in the long-term added value of WUQM Consulting, depending on the competence, and what contribution the employee can make to the continuous improvement process of the environmental management system. Both are carried out in accordance with the company guidelines. An incentive system represents the employee's profit participation on the basis of a performance-related premium model, which is also designed individually. If the company generates a surplus, the employees are involved in this in the form of a distribution. As a micro enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting does not have a control body (supervisory board/counsel) for the management. . Performance indicators for criterion 8 . Performance Indicator G4-51a Compensation Policy \\u2013 Report on the remuneration policy for the highest supervisory body and senior executives. . As a micro-enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting does not have a supervisory body (supervisory board/advisory board) for the management. No key figures are collected for the remuneration policy of the management. . Performance Indicator G4-54 Specify the ratio of the annual remuneration of the highest paid employee in each country with significant business activities to the average level (median) of the total annual remuneration of all employees (excluding the highest paid employee) in the same country. . As a micro-enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting has only one location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The indicator has not yet been collected. . 9. Participation of Stakeholder Groups . The company discloses how social and economically relevant stakeholders are identified and integrated into the sustainability process. It discloses whether and how a continuous dialogue with them is maintained and how its results are integrated into the sustainability process. . In the course of a workshop, the WUQM Consulting team identified the diverse stakeholder groups that are directly or indirectly affected by the company's decisions or have claims to the company. A stakeholder map shows the degree of concern (intensity of communication, claims and influence) of the stakeholder groups (see Sustainability Report with integrated Environmental Statement 2015, p. 9). The dialogue with the customers (permanent and project customers) is maintained through the implementation of the services of WUQM Consulting (consultations, trainings, audits, etc.) and by means of a questionnaire for satisfaction with the services provided. The feedback of the customers finds influence in the employee discussions and in the meetings of the management. The competencies, needs and goals of the permanent employees are examined in half-yearly employee discussions with the management and taken into account in the company planning. For the integrated management system there is an internal proposal system, which is used as a pool of ideas for measures to improve the sustainability performance of WUQM Consulting. Communication to governmental institutions and regional stakeholders is carried out on a discontinuous basis and if necessary, e.g. for the implementation of joint events. The suppliers of WUQM Consulting are limited to few, environmentally-oriented and partly also certified providers. There are usually very long-term and trusting business relationships. Supporting stakeholders are cooperation partners, networks, business associations, regional organisations and local neighbours. The above-mentioned forums and stakeholders serve WUQM Consulting for the exchange of experience, for the use of synergies, for project generation and as multipliers for the offer and commitment of WUQM Consulting. For a more targeted participation of the identified stakeholders is provided a team workshop for the analysis of the needs of the stakeholders and their integration into the sustainability process. . Performance indicators for criterion 9 . Performance Indicator G4-27 Name the most important issues and concerns that have arisen through stakeholder involvement and how the organisation has responded to those important issues and concerns, including through reporting. Name the stakeholder groups that have addressed the key issues and concerns. . Extension of the EMAS environmental management system to include the EMASplus sustainability management system, in particular the integration of social concerns into the management system; application of the sustainability code in a fair manner when carrying out own events; health management with specific offers for our own employees (in planning) . In the personal contact with customers and via the questionnaire on customer satisfaction, the customer's concerns are brought to us. Here, in particular, extensions or individualizations of our services are made. However, the customers and partners of WUQM Consulting are also important drivers for the own management system. WUQM Consulting has implemented the following: The following were realized from the ideas and suggestions of the employees via the internal proposal system: . Initiation and implementation of EMAS certification; conduct of a coaching for the management and employees for team building as well as for the optimization of the internal organization and workflows; possibility of leasing e-bikes for employees (in planning); compensation of CO2 emissions for a climate-neutral business operation (in planning) . 10. Innovation and product management . The company discloses how it contributes through appropriate processes to improving the sustainability of its own resource use and users through innovations in products and services. It also explains whether and how their current and future impact is assessed in the value chain and in the product lifecycle for the essential products and services. . everyday contact with customers from different industries in positions relevant for sustainable development (sustainability, environmental, energy, quality management, data protection officer, etc.) in companies and public institutions; intensive regular exchange in networks, forums, working groups and convoys; continuous training and further training of employees . WUQM Consulting is always open to external impulses and suggestions and strives to take up innovative products and current social developments in its work. It plays a pioneering role, for example, by introducing the integrated EMASplus management system, by ensuring fair compliance with the sustainability code and by using a plug-in hybrid vehicle by the management. WUQM Consulting has the necessary access to the relevant and up-to-date information: With the introduction of environmental, quality or sustainability management systems, it strengthens the sustainable management of organizations. Positive effects are achieved through long-term change and improvement processes. Clear savings targets are set, among other things, in the areas of waste, energy, emissions and continuous work on improving environmental performance. All customers, e.g. EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme), publish an externally tested environmental declaration in which the ecological effects of their services and products are described and are documented with indicators. In the spring of 2014, WUQM conducted the study \\\"EMAS - Satisfaction and Exploitation of EMASplus, Environmental Psychological Results Evaluation on the basis of a Customer Survey\\\" in cooperation with a Research and Development Office. 28 companies were asked about their satisfaction with EMAS and the EMASeasy methodology and their potential for expanding the existing environmental management system to a sustainability management system. All companies developed and implemented an ambitious environmental program. Above all, the employee involvement by the EMASeasy methodology was rated as particularly positive by 89 percent. Whether the final environmental explanation was of benefit and was asked for was affirmed by 70 percent. As other positive effects, transparency, encouragement for savings, improvement of the quality standard as a whole or an increase in environmental awareness among employees were mentioned. . Performance indicators for criterion 10 . Performance indicator G4-FS11 Percentage of financial assets subject to a positive or negative selection test according to environmental or social factors. . This indicator is not relevant due to the current business situation and position. . 11. Utilization of natural resources . The company discloses the extent to which natural resources are used for business activities, including materials as well as the input and output of water, soil, waste, energy, area, biodiversity and emissions for the life cycle of products and services. . In 2014, WUQM Consulting prepared an input-output analysis for the first time and has continued it annually since then. The balance sheet contains several environmental indicators that document, among other things, the resource consumption of WUQM Consulting and, if necessary, the improvement of environmental performance: Basic data Input Output The exact consumption data and specific environmental indicators can be found in the updated 2017 Environmental Statement. . Useful area: heated net floor space in square metres; employees: number of full-time equivalents, share of women, share of full-time jobs, share of permanent contracts .

Resource management . The Company shall disclose the qualitative and quantitative objectives it has set for its resource efficiency, in particular the use of renewable energies, the increase in raw material productivity and the reduction of the use of ecosystem services, the measures and strategies it pursues, how they have been or are to be fulfilled in the future and where it sees risks. . The corporate guidelines stipulate that WUQM Consulting takes into account the impact of its actions on the environment and assumes its social responsibility in its corporate decisions. This implies a careful use of natural resources, which is reflected in the following measures: . Company headquarters: move to a former brewery in W\\u00fcrzburg with offices in the historic brewhouse of B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u (renovation in 2014 to EnEV standard), equipped to 100% with energy-efficient LED lighting; from 01.01.2018: conversion to 100% green electricity, laying of environmentally friendly floor coverings from recycled material and renewable raw materials; resource and energy-saving practices in everyday office life: exclusive use of recycling paper (blue angel), pre-setting of the printer to double-sided SW printing, use of batteries (no batteries), refill and reusable packaging (e.g. hand soap, glass bottles, sodastream) as well as use of cloth towels in the sanitary rooms, equipment with flow limiters on taps and water-saving buttons on toilets, separation of waste into four fractions (paper, plastic, residual waste and biowaste), switching of electrical equipment with socket strips outside working hours; implementation of the Directive on eco-fair procurement with minimum criteria and waste. a. for the new purchase of products (office furniture, office materials, IT equipment, food and beverages, cleaning products, occupational clothing etc.); sustainable mobility (objective 2017: 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2014): use of the railway as a primary means of transport for business trips (measurement: BahnCard 50 with 100% green electricity for all employees), leasing of a plug-in hybrid vehicle for the management, installation of two e-charging stations at the company parking spaces, possibility for employees to lease an e-bike, reimbursement of travel costs of the \\u00d6PNV ticket for employees for the work journey, introduction of a business travel directive (2018 in planning); sustainable event management (\\\"Green Meetings\\\"): implementation of events according to the sustainability code fair, i.e. as paper-free design (scripts on USBStick), extensive organic catering of suppliers with regional and seasonal offer, extension of the seminar portfolio with webinars (2018 in planning) .

Until now, the consumption of electricity and heat has been collected for this indicator. Due to delays in the calculation of ancillary costs, the current data for the year 2016 are not yet available. They will be added soon after their receipt. With the move to the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areal in W\\u00fcrzburg in November 2015, a change of the electricity and heat supplier took place. Currently, WUQM Consulting is still bound to a framework contract of the project development company of the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areals. At the beginning of 2018 the transition to 100% green electricity is planned. In the complete renovation of the listed building and the office premises, energy efficiency measures were in the foreground. For the heating of the rooms, a low-temperature floor heating system is used, which is supplied via a central gas combustion plant. In summer, the office spaces can be cooled over the floor by approx. 2 \\u00b0C. . Performance indicator G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption. . Refurbishment according to the ENEV standard in 2014; installation of insulating glass windows; low-temperature floor heating and cooling, which is supplied with heat via a central gas combustion system . As a result of the relocation in autumn 2015, it is not yet possible to make a comparison between 2014, 2015 and 2016 and to make savings on concrete measures or indicators. The new building has other structural requirements: The following measures to reduce energy consumption were implemented with the move to the new premises: . Installation of 100% LED lighting; procurement of energy efficient appliances: refrigerator and dishwasher class A++, energy-saving induction stove . Performance indicator G4-EN8 Total water abstraction by source. . Water and wastewater --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . Hot water -- tc-- m3 -- tc-- 3.0 -- tc-- 2.9 -- tc-- k.A. .

Water consumption per employee -- tc-- m3 -- tc-- 3,4 -- tc-- 3,1 -- tc-- 1,2 . For the indicator hot water consumption, there are no data available for 2016. These are supplemented as soon as they are available. According to the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (Sustainable Building Assessment System), the average consumption for office and administrative buildings is about 20 to 30 litres per working day and employee. At WUQM Consulting, consumption has so far been around 19 litres per working day and employee. Thus, this is just below the average. . Performance indicator G4-EN23 Total weight of waste by type and method of disposal. . The data for the collection of the key figures on waste generation have been estimated since 2016 on the volume of waste containers and the frequency of their emptying. The waste is separated into four fractions (paper/cartonage, plastic/packaging waste, residual waste and biowaste) and collected in a common waste collection room on the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u site. The waste is disposed of in specified cycles via the collection system of the city cleaners, an EMAS-certified own operation of the city of W\\u00fcrzburg. Dangerous waste does not occur in office operations. The large amount of paper and cardboard in 2015 is due to the move in November 2015. . Waste generation --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . Residual waste -- tc-- kg -- tc-- 31 -- tc-- 31 -- tc-- 47 . Organic waste -- tc-- kg -- tc-- -- -- tc-- -- -- tc-- 50 .

Recycling rate --tc-- % --tc-- 88 --tc-- 93 --tc-- 87 . 13. Climate-related emissions . The company discloses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol or standards based on it and sets its own emission reduction targets. . WUQM Consulting produces emissions through professional mobility, indirectly through the consumption of electricity and heat, and indirectly through the consumption of office paper. We have achieved the target of reducing CO2 emissions from mobility by 15 percent (i.e. by 1,8250 kg) by the end of 2017. CO2 emissions from diesel consumption have fallen continuously since 2015 and amounted to only 9,449 kg of CO2 (approx. 3,000 litres) in 2017, compared with 12,172 kg in 2015 (approx. 3,900 litres). This means a saving of 2,723 kg (22 percent) of CO2 emissions. This goal was achieved by: Avoiding business travel through video and telephone conferences; bundling of business trips, use of the railway, replacement of a diesel vehicle by a plug-in hybrid in January 2017. The railway kilometres have therefore increased from 10,639 km (2016) to 29,128 km (2017). Despite the growing business, the performance of the two company cars has decreased from 63,000 km (2014) to 50,220 km in 2017. The goal of reducing indirect emissions from paper consumption is to save paper and use of 100% recycled paper with the Blue Angel. The basic settings of the printer are pre-set in black and double-sided. Customer correspondence is predominantly digital. Advertising for own events and seminars is also predominantly digital. Despite the growth in personnel and increased number of in-house seminars, indirect emissions from paper consumption with 38.6 kg of CO2 remained almost the same compared to 2015 with 38.1 kg of CO2. In 2014 and 2015, no indirect CO2 emissions were generated by the purchase of electricity from 100% hydropower. For the heat consumption from heating oil, values of 10,422 kg (2014) and 9,732 kg (2015) were generated. From 01.11.2015, the WUQM has acquired new office space and heats the rooms by means of economical low-temperature floor heating with natural gas, thus achieving enormous CO2 savings. 2015: Consumption of 30,413 kWh, CO2 emissions: 9,732 kg CO2 2016: Consumption of 5,580 kWh, CO2 emissions: 1,400 kg CO2 The purchase of 100% green electricity from renewable energies is very important for WUQM and will be implemented in the coming months. Further reduction targets and measures for 2018/2019 will only be developed in March/April and will be published in the next validated environmental statement in May 2018.The calculation of greenhouse gas and air pollutants volumes is not based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), but on the Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems (GEMIS) and the sustainability calculator of the Pro Recycling Paper (IPR) initiative. . Performance indicators for criterion 13 . Performance indicator G4-EN15 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1). . Emissions --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 .

Performance indicator G4-EN17 Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). . Emissions --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . CO2 emissions from paper consumption (0.93g/kg) --tc-- kg CO2e --tc-- 36 --tc-- 38 --tc-- 36 . Further indirect CO2 emissions from WUQM Consulting result from the consumption of office paper (100% recycled paper, Blue Angel). The sustainability calculator of the Initiative Pro Recycling Paper (IPR) is used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions. . Performance indicator G4-EN19 Reduction of GHG emissions. . A concrete environmental goal is to reduce CO2 emissions from mobility by 15% by the end of 2017 compared to 2014. In order to achieve this goal, internal measures were carried out to promote cycling, public transport and the use of rail as a primary means of transport for business trips. In addition, a plug-in hybrid vehicle was leased by the management in January 2017. At the end of 2017, data on possible savings in CO2 emissions and other air pollutants are available for the first time. According to the environmental balance of Deutsche Bahn, the following savings were achieved by WUQM Consulting through journeys by rail instead of journeys by car between 01/2016 and 12/2016 (assuming rail and car journeys are identical from mileage): .

The company reports on how it complies with nationally and internationally recognised standards on employee rights and promotes the participation of employees in the company and in the company's sustainability management, which goals it sets itself, which results have been achieved so far and where it sees risks. . A goal defined in the company guidelines of WUQM Consulting is to promote the motivation and satisfaction of employees. The basis is the compliance with the applicable legal regulations for occupational health and safety in Germany, as employees are insured under German labour law and WUQM is only active nationally. Important here are above all the occupational safety law, the mother protection law, the workplace regulation with all relevant workplace directives (especially for VDU workplaces) and the occupational safety regulation. The internal safety specialist (currently: Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig) keeps the risk assessment, operating instructions and other legally required documents up-to-date and carries out the annual employee training on occupational health and safety. In addition, we have been EMAS certified since April 2016 and also meet the requirements of the EMASplus guideline. The EMASplus sustainability management system has a holistic understanding of corporate social responsibility and takes into account environmental aspects (through compliance with the EMAS regulation and the UM- Standard ISO 14001) also provides economic and social aspects. The guideline is based on the internationally recognized CSR guide ISO 26000 on corporate social responsibility. Its seven core topics are organisation management, fair business and business practices, human rights, consumer concerns, work practices, involvement and development of the community. To ensure good and fair work practices, half-yearly employee discussions are held. For more information see Sustainability Report 2015, p. 27. In weekly team meetings, an exchange is held on the current projects and the available resources of the employees. Within the framework of the sustainability management system EMASplus, annual internal audits and every two years external audits are carried out by an EMAS environmental expert. The internal team, led by the sustainability representatives, initiates new objectives, the improvement programme and the continued development of the management system. In the monitoring of the sustainability performance of WUQM Consulting, there are so far only few indicators on economic and social aspects. . 15. Equal opportunities . The company discloses how it implements national and international processes and what goals it has to promote equal opportunities and diversity, occupational safety and health protection, participation, integration of migrants and people with disabilities, adequate pay and agreement of family and work, and how it implements them. . WUQM Consulting aims to achieve an honest and regular exchange with its employees (see company guidelines). This will be implemented in particular in the context of six-monthly employee discussions with the management. In this context, the framework conditions such as workload, organisation, qualification, responsibility as well as an appropriate remuneration are discussed. Employees' salary wishes are accepted and evaluated in terms of their feasibility. As there are no fixed remuneration structures for corporate consulting, the quality of our services must convince the customer in order to be able to manage successfully. On the part of the management, the aim is to pay employees appropriately and fairly in order to bind professionals to the company in the long term. This is implemented by a performance-related salary model, with which employees are involved in the company's success. This means that they receive a performance premium in addition to their net salary at the end of the financial year. There is no difference between gender, appearance, origin, religion or view of values. Qualified applications from abroad are particularly taken into account in order to offer employment opportunities to people of other backgrounds. However, this has first occurred. All employees are employed full-time for an unlimited period and full-time as desired. A flexible flexitime model and the possibility of mobile work facilitate the reconciliation of family and work for the employees. Men and women are treated equally and work on projects largely independently. The proportion of women in projects is 50 percent. For the health promotion and prevention of back pain, three height-adjustable tables have been created, which allow for a change between standing and sitting work. Access to office spaces is possible for people with disabilities by means of elevator. . (ii) the need to improve the quality of training; . The company discloses the objectives it has set and the measures it has taken to promote employability, i.e. the ability to participate in the working and professional world of all employees, and to adapt it to demographic trends, and where it sees risks. . Each employee is entitled to three training days per year. A competence matrix for the WUQM Consulting team is used to optimize the internal work organisation. The permanent recruitment of the personnel underlines the strategy of the management to develop and maintain employees in the company in the long term. The continuous training and rapid self-responsible project cooperation brings positive effects both for the company and for the employees. WUQM Consulting employs employees with different vocational trainings and from different age groups. In the field of health, preventive approaches are mainly pursued. In this way, height-adjustable tables have been procured, which enable employees to work flexibly in sitting or standing. The development of a health management system is currently being planned. . Performance indicators for criteria 14 to 16 . Performance indicator G4-LA6 Type of injury and rate of injury, occupational diseases, days lost and absence and total number of work-related deaths by region and sex. .

WUQM Consulting has introduced a binding guideline for eco-fair procurement, which defines minimum criteria for product properties in terms of environmental friendliness, recyclability and disposal, as well as for manufacturers and suppliers in terms of compliance with general human rights and environmental, occupational and health protection. For guidance, reference is made to trusted labels, certifications and product declarations, e.g. Blue Angel, Fairtrade, GEPA and GEPA fair+. Memo AG is our main supplier of office materials, which mainly refers to its goods from Germany and Europe and carries out an extensive audit of environmental and sustainability aspects prior to inclusion in the assortment. . Performance indicators for criterion 17 . Performance indicator G4-HR1 Total number and percentage of significant investment agreements and contracts that contain human rights clauses or have been examined from a human rights perspective. . As there are no investment agreements and contracts, this indicator is not collected. . Performance indicator G4-HR9 Total number and percentage of business locations audited for human rights or human rights implications. . 100%. WUQM Consulting has only one location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The company is EMAS and EMASplus certified. External validation has encouraged the introduction of a formal anti-corruption policy. . Performance indicator G4-HR10 Percentage of new suppliers verified on the basis of human rights criteria. . Based on its environmental procurement policy, WUQM Consulting is usually looking for (environmental) certified suppliers from the region to test products for environmental and social compatibility prior to inclusion in the product range. By mid-2018, WUQM Consulting intends to carry out a comprehensive supplier assessment with regard to sustainability criteria. If the assessment indicates that the negative effects in the supply chain are to be feared, appropriate measures will be taken. . G4-HR11 performance indicator Significant actual and potential negative human rights impacts in the supply chain and measures taken. . Since WUQM Consulting is a consulting company, human rights implications in the supply chain may be relevant for the procurement of office and IT equipment as well as for food. In order to fulfil its social responsibility, WUQM Consulting has introduced a guideline for eco-fair procurement and signed the sustainability code in a fair manner for the event industry. . 18. Community . The company shall disclose how it contributes to the community in the regions where it carries out essential business activities. . As a consulting company for the introduction of quality, environmental and sustainability management systems, WUQM Consulting supports customers throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. However, companies or public institutions within a radius of approx. 200 km are mainly advised from the W\\u00fcrzburg location. Seminars, workshops and information events are offered in line with the business fields. WUQM Consulting is a long-standing member of the Environmental Protection Association Unterfranken e.V. (FUU e.V.), whose first board is the managing director of WUQM Consulting, Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig. promotes sustainable business in the region of Lower Franconia through projects, working groups and seminar events.

In autumn 2019 \\u2013 almost exactly 120 years after the company\\u2019s founding \\u2013 we launched the biggest growth and innovation initiative in the history of Miele. The goal of this programme is to guide our independent family-owned company into the future from a position of strength. Exam- ples include a new organisational structure, a focus on new growth fields and advances in our digital expertise. Just a few months later, however, we faced an entirely different development: the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Miele has consistently focused on pro- tecting its employees as the top priority in coping with the challenges the pandemic has brought. To keep operations up and run- ning as far as possible at the same time, comprehensive protective measures were taken and maintained rigorously. Large parts of office operations were shifted to remote work from one day to the next. Almost all contacts with retailers went digital. The fact that we were able to conclude the year 2020 very successfully in eco- nomic terms in spite of the circumstances shows once again that trustworthy brands and outstanding quality serve as important anchors, providing stability even \\u2013 and espe- cially \\u2013 in times of crisis. But of everything we are grateful for, the biggest thanks go to our more than 20,000 employees. Since the start of the pandemic, they have been working under trying conditions, whether due to loss of earnings from shorter working hours or from additional stress caused by school and day care closures.

For the past 120 years, we at Miele have been guided by our founders\\u2019 maxim \\u201cImmer Besser\\u201d, adhering firmly to this idea even or especially in turbulent times. The past year was no exception, and we did not let up in our efforts to reach our sustainability goals. Quite the opposite, in fact: In October 2020, the Executive Board adopted a much more ambi- tious sustainability strategy, defining a new climate action strategy with ambitious climate targets in the process. As one of these aims, we are striving to reduce our CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 50 percent compared to 2019 levels by the year 2030. Miele is guided in these efforts by the central aim of the Paris Agreement, limiting global warming to signif- icantly below 2\\u00b0C \\u2013 or 1.5\\u00b0C if possible \\u2013 as compared to the pre-industrial era. The sci- entifically based confirmation of our climate targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (STBi) in the summer of 2021 has once again emphasised this. As the first step If 2020 has taught us one thing, it is that global crises cannot be resolved by taking a wait-and-see approach. Instead, they call for decisive action. That is also true of climate change, which poses a wide range of risks to Miele as a com- pany with worldwide value chains. But climate action is not the only area where we have set new goals for ourselves. In terms of our products, too, we plan to fur- ther sharpen our focus in the future on not only durability and efficient use, but also aspects such as recyclability, repairability and resource efficiency. At the same time, we need to explore new market opportu- nities through business models that are both innovative and sustainable. And last but not least, we are further expanding our work on digital responsibility in an effort to strengthen our customers\\u2019 trust in our increasingly digitally connected products. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Our work on sustainability reflects our pledge to uphold the ten universal prin- ciples of the UN Global Compact, which we joined back in 2004.

Miele aims to continuously delight its customers with unparalleled quality, innova- tive technology, perfect results and timeless elegance, while also playing a pioneering role in energy efficiency and environmental protection. \\u201cImmer Besser\\u201d, the prece- dent set by the company founders, sums it up. The owners and Executive Board feel an obligation towards the employees, cus- tomers, suppliers, the environment and society. Miele embodies partnership-based conduct towards its business partners, an em ployee-focused corporate culture as well as continuity of values, goals and leader- ship. The family-owned company is now in its fourth generation, with the two founding fami- lies Miele and Zinkann holding 100 percent of the shares. This ensures independence from the interests of external investors. In the core domestic appliance business, the company focuses on the Miele brand and its positioning in the premium segment. Digital products and services from the Smart Home division play an increasingly important role. INNOVATION AND GROWTH INITIATIVE In 2019, Miele began fundamentally reposi- tioning its organisation. The goal is to further expand on its leading market position in the premium segment in domestic and commer- cial appliances while also safeguarding the economic efficiency of the entire Miele Group on a lasting basis. The restructuring of worldwide sales activities is also among the biggest innovation and growth initiatives in the company\\u2019s history, with the focus shifting to aspects such as markets with high potential, like China and North America. Beyond that, Miele is also ramping up its investments in the company\\u2019s digital exper- tise and has established a site in Amsterdam focusing on digital marketing and digital sales. To strengthen corporate responsibility within the organisation, Miele has pooled together its operational business in eight independently operating business units (BUs): Laundry, Dishwashing, Cooking, Refrigeration, Professional, Customer Service, Small Domestic Appliances (SDA) and the recently created New Growth Factory. It opens up new fields of business with bright prospects for the future. COMPANY HEADQUARTERS G\\u00fctersloh has been the headquar- ters of the Miele Group since 1907. EXECUTIVE BOARD The Executive Board consists of five Executive Directors with equal voting rights. These include two Executive Directors who act as representatives of the families of owners, as well as three Executive Directors with divi- sional responsibility who are not associated with the families.

The chain ends with recycling or disposal of the appliances. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUPPLY CHAIN New business models and digital solutions are helping Miele open up new markets. However, this can also lead to new challenges regarding sustainability. Increasingly complex supply chains and an increasing scarcity of raw materials require more supply chain transparency. However, partnership-based supplier relationships and a shared commitment to respecting human rights and greater environmental protection offer opportunities. PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION PRODUCTION SALES & TRANSPORT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Increasing energy and resource efficiency in production is helping offset higher energy and material costs. For companies with a high level of vertical integration, the shortage of skilled workers also presents a risk. It can have a negative impact on productivity. Employee satisfaction is a decisive factor in meeting this challenge. Transport-related emis- sions are at the centre of public debate. In addition, the number of regulations is increa- sing. Logistics must be made more environ- mentally friendly. EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES USE RECYCLING & DISPOSAL Shifts in the market can have a positive or negative impact on the demand for sus- tainable products. The promotion of sustain- able consumption is an essential opportunity. Around the world, raw materials are becoming scarcer and their costs are rising. This requires comprehensive measures in order to conserve natural resources. Durable and recyclable products make a positive contribution, as does the increased use of recycled materials.

In light of the growing threat posed by climate change and the increasing scarcity of resources, Miele\\u2019s strategic focus today lies on the ambitious con- tinued expansion of its sustainability strategy, which states new targets for climate action, environmental protection and other urgent issues.

It is intended to serve as a model for all employees in their daily activities. Long-term objectives form the framework to this end. In 2016, Miele there- fore set out 15 strategic targets that are to be achieved by 2025. The company has already made significant progress on the path to completion. When it comes to climate action, for instance, energy con- sumption continued to fall at all locations in 2020. At the same time, Miele suc- ceeded in significantly reducing its CO2 emissions by cutting Scope 1 and 2 emis- sions by 40 percent compared to 2019, to name just one example. When it comes to resource conservation, the company deci- sively pursued the goal of making Miele appliances leaders in sustainable product design and integrated efficiency, allowing Miele to further increase the percentage of products sold with the highest energy effi- ciency ratings. Customers also continue to see Miele\\u2019s sustainability performance as very good worldwide, according to studies such as the 2020 \\u201cGr\\u00fcne Marken des Jahres\\u201d (Green brands of the year) survey by the international market research insti- tute YouGov and the magazine stern. In the study, consumers voted Miele number one in the category of electronic appliances. At the same time, Miele is aware that global challenges such as climate change have grown even more intense in recent years. Digitalisation and rising consumer expec- tations also result in new topics that need to be addressed. As a result, Miele car- ried out a large-scale project during the reporting period to ensure an even more ambitious approach to tackling indi- vidual topics of the sustainability strategy. This is especially true when it comes to climate action, environmental protection, the sustainability of Miele products and a responsible approach to digitalisation. STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT In the reporting period, Miele launched its global Design2Excellence > innovation and growth initiative to further strengthen the company\\u2019s competitiveness and future via- bility on a sustainable basis. The further development of the Miele sustainability strategy also counts towards this goal. Miele is doing justice to the high value of sus- tainability for the company and the brand through very ambitious new targets. At the same time, sustainability is being anchored even more firmly within the organisation and given a higher profile in the way the First place in the \\u201cGr\\u00fcne Marken des Jahres\\u201d consumer study in the electronic appliances category. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS company presents itself, including in how it communicates with customers. The revised strategy concentrates on three fields of focus: climate action, sustain- able products and packaging, and digital responsibility. These areas are ones in which the company can make a signifi- cant additional contribution to sustainability. Moreover, they are of particular relevance and urgency from a social perspective. From 2021, the targets and measures in the fields of focus will be further refined and specified in a sustainability programme. By drawing up their own sustainability programmes on the basis of the central strategy, the business units \\u2013 along with relevant central departments such as pur- chasing, human resources and logistics \\u2013 will be involved closely in implementing the enhanced sustainability strategy. FIELD OF FOCUS: CLIMATE PROTECTION Containing climate change and adapting to its impact are among the most pressing issues of our time. As a family-owned com- pany with worldwide value chains that is aware of its responsibility, Miele attaches particular importance to this global 12  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 challenge. That is why the company devel- oped a comprehensive climate action strategy during the reporting period and defined ambitious targets to support it. The strategy was adopted by the Executive Board in October 2020. At its core is avoiding, reducing and offsetting CO2 emissions. of Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint is attributable to these Scope 3 emissions, making it the key to > reducing emissions. Despite the vast complexities, Miele is taking a sys- tematic approach to this challenge and setting itself a goal in accordance with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative in this area as well. When it comes to the targets, Miele is guided by the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to significantly below 2\\u00b0C \\u2013 or 1.5\\u00b0C if possible \\u2013 as com- pared to the pre-industrial era. To ensure that Miele\\u2019s climate targets make an effec- tive contribution to achieving this goal, the company joined the internationally recog- nised > Science Based Targets initiative (STBi) in January 2021. Its membership is associated with an obligation to pursue a science-based emissions reduction target. One of the first interim goals is to achieve CO2 neutrality at all locations in 2021 as relates to the company\\u2019s own emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions attributable to energy suppliers (Scope 2). At the same time, Miele aims to reduce these emissions by 50 percent compared to 2019 by 2030. To do so, the company will make investments with a focus on improving the > energy effi- ciency of Miele\\u2019s locations and production plants while expanding the in-house gener- ation of electricity from renewable sources. In the medium and long term, the goal is also to significantly reduce CO2 emis- sions during the use of products, as in the past, and during the purchasing of goods and services (Scope 3). A substantial share FIELD OF FOCUS: SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING The second field of focus looks at Miele\\u2019s products and the way they are packaged. As the aim here is to further improve their sustainability scorecard, the tasks at hand include closing material cycles through the > use of recyclates or by improving the ability to repair products, to name just two exam- ples. The latter contributes to the exceptional durability of Miele products, which has proven to be > valuable from an ecological per- spective. Increasing resource efficiency is another item on the agenda. The goal is to ensure supply security for Miele in the long term while preserving reserves of raw mate- rials for future generations. Miele plans to lay the groundwork for achieving this goal during product development. With regard to the > packaging used in shipping, a project team is tasked with continuously reviewing alter- native materials so that Miele can continue switching to more environmentally friendly solutions. Miele also strives to use recycled or recyclable materials more often for the packaging of cleaning and care products. In addition, the company is working on new sus- tainable > business models that are designed to open up additional market opportunities. In order to achieve its climate targets, Miele also opts for generating its own electricity from renewable sources.

Miele therefore further developed its strategy in the fields of data protection and information security in the reporting period. Part of those efforts includes drawing up a \\u201cdigital product promise\\u201d that ensures the ability of consumers to use the digital functions of Miele products securely and in the long term. The relationship between the key topics and the SDGs is also indicated by the size of the circles on the materiality matrix. As part of the > further development of the sustainability strategy, Miele reviewed the find- ings of the analysis with regard to their current relevance and decided that they remained applicable. The matrix therefore continues to provide guidance for defining the focal points of Miele\\u2019s sustainability approach. CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS MATERIALITY [GRI 102-46/-47] Miele performs materi- ality analyses to determine the focal points of the sustainability strategy and reporting. In the process, the company looks into the potential impact of its business activities on sustainable development and gauges the expectations of external stakeholders in relation to the company. The most recent comprehensive > materiality analysis was performed in 2018. The global reference framework of the analysis was based on the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustain- ability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analysed topics were subsequently compiled and pre- sented in accordance with the standards of the GRI in a > materiality matrix. The hori- zontal axis of the materiality matrix presents the influence of external factors (outside-in), while the vertical axis presents Miele\\u2019s impact (inside-out) on the topic in question. In this report\\u2019s subchapters, Miele describes how the material topics are managed and what kind of progress the company made during the reporting period. In 2015, the United Nations adopted > 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are at the heart of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Devel- opment. The SDGs aim to address some of the most urgent global challenges from a sustainability perspective and reduce extreme poverty. Miele is expressly committed to the SDGs. The family-owned company makes a contribution to sustainable develop- ment through SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 in particular.

This applies equally to the produc- tion of Miele appliances and to their use and disposal, and also includes the company\\u2019s supply chain. Miele manages issues such as the conservation of resources, human rights, occupational safety and climate protection through an effective organisational structure using certified management systems. Compli- ance management ensures that applicable laws and Miele\\u2019s own guidelines are always observed. SYSTEMATIC SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT responsible for advancing the sustainability strategy in close cooperation with the Execu- tive Board, was expanded and renamed Corporate Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs (SRA) in 2021. Its renaming is an important signal within the company as to the important role of sustainability today and in the future. Along with many other departments, TPE was also responsible for implementing and moni- toring the sustainability strategy. The department heads at the company\\u2019s headquar- ters and the heads of the business units, as well as the heads of the sales regions and the heads of the sales subsidiaries, are responsible for ensuring that the objectives are achieved. Miele performs a systematic comparison of the objectives and key figures on sustainability performance on an annual basis. SUSTAINABILITY ORGANISATION Central sustainability management committees Executive Board Sustainability Board controls and decides Initiatives develop overarching solutions for focus topics [GRI 102-18/-20] Sustainability is ultimately the responsibility of the five-member Executive Board. The Board specifies the strategic direction, adopts objectives and defines indicators for measuring progress.

By reorganising the central Sustainability Com- mittee, Miele is working towards one of the main targets of the enhanced sustainability strategy: anchoring sustainability even more firmly throughout the company. Unlike in the past with the Sustainability Committee, the entire Miele Executive Board is accordingly represented on the new Sustainability Board, where it comes into contact with the heads and representatives of all relevant areas. The heads of the busi- ness units also belong to the Sustainability Board. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS [GRI 102-12/-16] A variety of principles and international guidelines to which Miele is committed form the basis for sustainability management: Corporate philosophy: prescribed principles, for example from the areas of quality and product safety, environmental protection, energy management, employee and cus- tomer orientation, or regarding specific sustainability aspects. These principles apply to all employees. Code of conduct of the > German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers\\u2019 Association (ZVEI) for socially responsible corporate management Code of conduct of the European Com- mittee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers > APPLiA (formerly CECED) for corporate social responsibility Code of conduct as part of the Association for Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics (BME) > compliance initiative to reduce compliance risks in the supply chain During its existence, the Sustainability Committee met at regular intervals, most recently convening four times in 2019. The committee dealt with the latest regulatory developments and discussed the resulting requirements for Miele. Examples include the EU regulation on energy consumption labelling, the European Strategy for Plastics and Germany\\u2019s National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights. Due to the further development of the sustainability strategy, the Sustainability Committee did not hold any official meetings in 2020. Instead, the Executive Board and the relevant areas were involved in the development process at different intervals. The committee also helped to oversee the process of imple- menting the sustainability strategy at plant level. Responsibility for doing so was handed over to the Sustainability Board in December 2020.

It combines all the tools and standards for adhering to various sustaina- bility requirements (see > table). The integrated management system is regularly reviewed in internal and external audits. The latest cer- tificate for quality, environmental protection, energy management and occupational health and safety was issued on 15 December 2020 and is valid until 14 December 2023. The FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS certificate for social standards is valid until 25 July 2022. The employees who are responsible for the individual areas of the management system report regularly on their progress to the Executive Board. In addition, the relevant departments at the locations in G\\u00fctersloh and Bielefeld have also been certified according to the ISO 13485 standard for quality management of med- ical products. The certifications in line with the SA8000 social standard will be succes- sively renewed for all locations by July 2022. 90 internal and external audits were conducted as part of quality management in 2020. 17  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Overview PRODUCTION SITES G\\u00fctersloh Arnsberg Bielefeld B\\u00fcnde Euskirchen Lehrte Oelde Warendorf B\\u00fcrmoos (Austria) Bra\\u015fov (Romania) Dongguan (China) Uni\\u010dov (Czech Republic) Ksawer\\u00f3w1) (Poland) MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Products Tools and standards Washing machines, washer dryers, electronic components, foundry Cooker hoods Dishwashers for domestic and commercial purposes, washer-disinfectors, vacuum cleaners Steam ovens, hob units, warming drawers Electric motors, cable feels, fans Laundry machines, rotary ironers Cookers, ovens, Dialog oven Plastic parts Metal components Electronic components Vacuum cleaners Washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers Production FACTS & FIGURES ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment), ISO 45001 (Occupational safety), SA8000 (Social standard) ISO 50001 (Energy) 1) The new location in Ksawer\\u00f3w gained certification in May 2021.

The certification of the European company locations involves a matrix certification procedure. The Dongguan location plans and organises its certification independently, but remains closely interlinked with the Miele management system and the MES. In all cases, external auditors check the processes that are relevant to the certification. In 2020, 29 external integrated management system audits were performed. That figure stood at 36 in 2019. No non-conformities were found in either year. Miele Material Group Management MGM INTERNAL PROGRESS REVIEW Employees [GRI 412-1/-2] In addition to external auditing, Miele operates an internal auditing process. As a self-monitoring system, it allows Miele THE MIELE SUCCESS SYSTEM The integrated management system is inter- connected with the Miele Success System (MES) in many places. Consisting of four elements, the MES standardises and optimises processes. The proprietary IMNU 2.0 product development system, for example, allows Miele to maintain an overview of all key development aspects, from pre-development to series maturity. IMNU 2.0 includes an > environmental checklist. In the Miele Value Creation System (MWS), on the other hand, resource conserva- tion is anchored as a central design principle, with defined targets for considerations such as the durability of operating materials or the allocation of resources. Moreover, the Quality Core Processes (Q-KP) help to ensure func- tional production processes that are free of disruption and keep errors to a minimum. With the aid of Material Group Management (MGM), Miele reviews sustainability aspects, among other things, throughout the entire procure- ment process as part of targeted supplier audits and other tools. AUDITS BY AN EXTERNAL PARTNER [GRI 412-1] The central quality management at the company headquarters in G\\u00fctersloh plans and manages all external auditing and certifi- cation procedures at all locations.

Internal auditors review the integrated management system, as well as all associated areas. They work through specific questions about the various processes and standards, and also examine the extent to which the legal and certifica- tion requirements, as well as those of Miele customers, are fulfilled. During the process, they note positive aspects, along with areas for improvement, non-conformities and other observations. In addition, the internal audi- tors arrange for improvement measures and monitor them during the next audit. Audi- tors with qualifications and experience that are relevant to the task guarantee that the audit is carried out appropriately. In the busi- ness year 2020, 61 internal audits took place.

In 2019, 98 audits took place, identifying two non-conformities related to energy management and occupa- tional health and safety. In response, Miele took both immediate and long-term measures. SUCCESSFUL RISK MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-11/-15] As a global company, Miele is exposed to a wide range of different risks. At the same time, developments in the company\\u2019s environment offer many opportu- nities for its business activities. Identifying and assessing non-financial risks plays a pivotal role in risk management at Miele. The company performs careful anal- ysis to identify the areas along the value chain where negative effects on people and the environment could occur. In addition, Miele checks to see where rising sustaina- bility requirements for the company could negatively impact its business development. Risk management uses a two-level system at Miele that is composed of central representa- tives for risk management and decentralised risk managers within the company\\u2019s oper- ating units. The central risk management team coordinates the overall process of identifying and assessing risks by potential loss and probability of occurrence. It is also responsible for taking appropriate risk management measures. The decentralised risk managers report regularly on the risks they identify and take measures to avoid and mitigate them. SUSTAINABILITY: KEY CHALLENGES [GRI 102-11/-15, 201-2] The greatest sustaina- bility risks for Miele lie in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate goods, as well as in climate change. As a manufacturing company, Miele is dependent on the availability of certain raw materials. However, the consumption of limited natural resources continues to rise constantly worldwide. A potential scarcity of raw materials is therefore a significant sustainability risk for Miele. The adverse effects on the environment that are associ- ated with the extraction and processing of raw materials \\u2013 as well as the later use and disposal of the products \\u2013 pose a problem, as they could lead to the loss of biodiversity and increasing soil degradation, to name just a few examples. Such effects also have a direct impact on the financial situation of companies, for instance in the form of rising material costs. Against this backdrop, Miele is developing a variety of approaches to reduce the need for primary raw materials and conserve natural resources in the process. The principle of circularity (circular economy) is also of growing importance. Due to a lack of regulations and legal precedence, how- ever, its implementation is complicated. With its durable and > recyclable products, Miele is already making a positive contribution to resource conservation today. The greater use of recyclates and the manufacturing of particularly energy- and > resource-efficient products help to meet key sustainability targets related to the creation of a circular economy. Miele expects the trend towards increasingly complex supply chains to gain strength, which will make it even more difficult to create transpar- ency and avoid bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials and components. Such developments will also further complicate compliance and monitoring with regard to environmental and social standards along the supply chain. The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated the complexity of the supply chain and the resulting difficulties. Despite these challenges, Miele is committed to labour and human rights standards along the supply chain, as well as to compliance with the principles of sustainable corporate management. To this end, the company performs regular > supplier audits and requests certifications from its business partners in order to mitigate supply chain risks. At the same time, the company maintains supplier relationships based on a spirit of partnership and works with its suppliers to navigate the wide-ranging requirements. This partnership-based approach ensures transpar- ency and increases reliability. Climate change is a further material sus- tainability risk for companies. The scientific community almost unanimously expects global average temperatures to rise by 2.5 to four degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically curbed. Extreme heat waves and rising sea levels already threaten natural resource ecosystems today, with a loss of pros- perity (including water and food shortages) a FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS potential reality in the long term. For companies like Miele, such effects could lead to tempo- rary or lasting interruptions in supply chains, or even the loss of locations. Besides the direct impact, climate change could also be asso- ciated with indirect risks due to factors such as regulatory requirements and changes in customer behaviour. Moreover, liability risks in connection with claims for compensation could become a burden. In light of these dan- gers and the challenges for humanity as a whole, Miele supports the 1.5-degree target of the United Nations and has joined the Sci- ence Based Targets initiative in order to develop > science-based climate targets. The company is focused on durability, as well as energy- and resource efficiency. Special emphasis is placed on the utilisation phase of its appli- ances, in which the environmental and climate impact is particularly pronounced in relation to the overall effect of Miele\\u2019s activities. More effi- cient, lower-CO2 logistics is another focal point. Miele plans to conduct a climate impact assessment to enable it to reliably evaluate the effect of climate change on its own business activities, as well as the resulting economic consequences. In the reporting period, Miele initially concentrated on identifying and prior- itising further measures to reduce CO2 emissions and improve data transparency. Since January 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant new sustainability risks for Miele, particularly in the field of occupational health and safety. > Various measures have been introduced at all locations to protect the company and its employees from infection with Covid-19. 20  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-16/-17, 206-1] Fair and cooperative conduct vis-\\u00e0-vis all internal and external partners is part of the corporate culture at Miele. Employees worldwide are obliged to abide by the law at all times, and to comply with internal guidelines, as well as self-imposed ethical and social standards. The Miele Code of Conduct was introduced in 2008 as a reflection of this obligation. It was most recently reviewed and updated in 2020. The Code, which is available on the Miele intranet, contains provisions on how to prevent bribery and corruption, as well as policies on proper conduct in relation to conflicts of interest, donations and sponsoring. It man- dates strict adherence to competition and antitrust legislation. In the reporting period, as in the years before it, there were no antitrust proceedings against Miele. > The Code of Conduct is based on the corporate philosophy, the ethical guidelines for procurement, the principles of the UN Global Compact, the SA8000 social standard and the APPLiA Code of Conduct (formerly CECED). Since 2011, Miele has been a member of the > BME compliance initiative, thereby underscoring its obligation to introduce processes for compliance and sustainable business practices at the company and implement them in its own supply chain. Compliance with individual aspects of the Code of Conduct, such as receiving and offering gifts, or how to deal with conflicts of interest, are reviewed in internal audits. In the event of violations, the company will agree on corrective measures. As a rule, however, it is the responsi- bility of the functional managers to put appropriate guidelines in place to ensure that their employees\\u2019 tasks are always carried out in compliance with applicable laws, internal rules and the self-imposed ethical and social standards. RAISING EMPLOYEES\\u2019 AWARENESS OF COMPLIANCE [GRI 102-17, 205-2, 412-2] It is mandatory for relevant groups of employees to participate in an online compliance training programme on the Miele Code of Conduct. This includes managers, as well as employees for whom the contents of the Miele Code of Conduct and the issue of compliance are particularly important. Such members of staff work primarily in the purchasing, internal audit, sales/field sales and specialist sales depart- ments or as customer services. New employees are automatically informed that they have to complete the programme. The programme is also open to all interested employees from other areas. To date, 4,122 employees participated in the online compliance training programme. 4,122 people worldwide have taken part in the training programme on the Code of Conduct, 409 of them during the reporting period. Since the end of 2016, employees at all locations involved in issues relating to competition and antitrust law are obliged to use this self-learning software on the subject of competition and antitrust legisla- tion. The programme ends with a test. Records are kept on whether tests were passed. There is also a legal management system for the areas of environmental protection, energy and occupational health and safety, and an information management software system addressing product-related regulation worldwide. OMBUDSPERSON AS A POINT OF CONTACT IF SUSPICIONS ARISE [GRI 102-17, 205-3, 419-1] Since 2010, employees have been able to turn to an external, independent ombudsperson \\u2013 or to their supervisor, HR management, internal audit, the works council or the Executive Board \\u2013 if they suspect corruption, fraud or theft within Miele\\u2019s sphere of influence. This option can also be used to report topics pertaining to human rights or data protection aspects. Employees, suppliers and third parties all over the world can take advantage of this service. The ombudsperson is addi- tionally available to provide advice on individual questions. All employees throughout the world, and all suppliers in Germany, are informed about the existence of the ombudsperson and their contact data FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS upon starting work or entering into a relation- ship with the company. If appropriate, suspicions are passed on to the central Auditing department for evaluation and review. The entire process can be handled anonymously upon request. No notifications relating to sustainability aspects were made to the ombudsperson during the reporting period. There were no instances of contracts with business partners being terminated or failing to be extended due to corruption- related violations. 21  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Stakeholder engagement Dialogue on an equal footing [GRI 102-40/-42] Miele\\u2019s products and pro- duction processes have different impacts on people and the environment. At the same time, the success and reputation of the company is also strongly influenced by the percep- tions, expectations, needs and decisions of its stakeholders. That is why Miele participates in > ongoing dialogue with all relevant stake- holder groups, including employees, customers and business partners, as well as associ- ations and interest groups, scientists and researchers, the general public, policymakers and legislators. Continuous stakeholder dia- logue helps the company to identify important trends and new developments, as well as risks and opportunities, at an early stage, and also to achieve common sustainability objectives. STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-42/-43] Stakeholder dialogue takes place on many different levels at Miele. > Corporate Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs (SRA), formerly known as the Technical Product Management and Environmental Office (TPE), plays a pivotal role in this respect. It maintains numerous contacts with experts and other stakeholders and is active in associations, conferences and dialogue forums at EU level, which enables it to help shape policy dialogue. Other areas of the company also maintain close contact with the stakeholders that are relevant for them. Corporate communications speaks to media representatives and the public, while customer service and marketing are in con- tact with customers and business partners. Experts from the specialist departments, such as energy management or purchasing, as well as members of the Executive Board, take part in conferences, working groups and dialogue forums. Visitors to the Miele locations also give the company valuable feedback. At international locations, the dialogue is generally the respon- sibility of the sales subsidiaries, in consultation with the appropriate specialist departments at the company headquarters if necessary. On account of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible to involve stakeholders in the usual manner in the reporting year. Visits to Miele\\u2019s sites were more or less impossible, and most events with external participants had to be cancelled. Alternatively, a selec- tion of digital exchange formats were offered. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY WORK Following the materiality process in 2018, stakeholder interviews with various opinion leaders and decision-makers were conducted in 2019. The goal was to gain deeper insights WIDESPREAD EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION Knowing the requirements of stakeholders is of tremen- dous importance for the further development of the > sustainability strategy, which is intended to serve in particular as a model for employees in their daily activi- ties. For this reason, Miele values a consistent understanding of sustainability that is anchored throughout the company. More than 100 employees got involved through a variety of workshops, video confer- ences and a wide-scale kick-off event, creating a broad basis for the upcoming transformation processes. CONTENTS 22  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 into strategic topics and identify specific areas of action and overlaps. The company talked to representatives of Germany\\u2019s Federal Min- istry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the Federal Min- istry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and the consumer advocacy association Ver- braucher Initiative e. V. Miele employees were also able to access an interview with climate researcher Mojib Latif on the intranet. With over 2,000 views, the echo was positive. VALUABLE FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS [GRI 102-43] Miele also conducts brand posi- tioning surveys several times a year. In these surveys, customers are asked a variety of ques- tions, including how well they believe Miele is meeting its ecological duties and what they think of the company\\u2019s commitment to sus- tainability. Between 2019 and the first quarter of 2021, Miele Brand Health Tracking, which is responsible for brand development, analysed some 54,000 interviews in 15 European coun- tries. In the interviews, customers were asked to evaluate the sustainability efforts of nine compa- nies from the industry. Miele took second place, just behind the top-ranked business and with a substantial lead over the third-placed company. These results confirm that Miele\\u2019s sustaina- bility performance is > perceived positively. POLITICAL INTERESTS [GRI 102-13] As a domestic appliance man- ufacturer, Miele is influenced by political decisions and legal requirements. The cor- responding guidelines and measures on issues such as the energy label, ecolog- ical design, hazardous substances and the circular economy have been drawn up pri- marily at a European level in recent years. Member states also draw up their own sus- tainability-related regulations that have an influence on Miele. Miele contributes its exper- tise to the debate surrounding the objectives and implementation of the guidelines through various > national and international commit- tees, commissions and associations. Topics such as national restrictions on substances and programmes for improving resource and material efficiency have also been dis- cussed in the process. In the reporting period, the discussions also centred on the digital- isation of products and services, as well as related questions regarding consumer pro- tection and the company\\u2019s responsibility. [GRI 102-13/-14] Miele maintains a contin- uous dialogue with political representatives who work at regional, national or European level. In its dealings with these representatives, the company argues that effective regulation for the environment, society and customers should be beneficial and should be realisable with as little additional bureaucratic effort as possible. To avoid distortions of competition, proposed legislation should also always be accompanied by a sound impact assessment that takes all potential market and environ- mental effects of the regulation into account and ensures transparency in terms of its imple- mentation. Since the end of 2015, Miele has been registered in the public transparency reg- ister for interest groups in Brussels to provide an insight into which representatives of the EU Commission, EU Parliament and the Euro- pean Council are in direct contact with Miele. WORK WITH ASSOCIATIONS In addition to advocating for certain political interests, company representatives are also involved in the work of national and international associations. One of the executive directors, Dr Markus Miele or Dr Reinhard Zinkann, is rep- resented on each of the boards of the German Central Association of the Electrical and Elec- tronics Industry ZVEI, the German Brands Association, the Stifterverband f\\u00fcr die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Donors\\u2019 association for the pro- motion of humanities and sciences) and \\u2013 at a regional level \\u2013 the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the trade association. Many members of staff are active on association and standardisation committees. Their tasks involve supporting the development of regulations and standards with their expertise while repre- senting Miele\\u2019s interests to the outside world. Miele actively works with associations through representatives of its sales subsidiaries in other EU member states and outside Europe as well. The company representatives then share the information they have gained on topics such as proposed legislation with the company itself. BENEFITING FROM PRACTICAL DIALOGUE [GRI 102-44] Miele also actively engages in dia- logue with environmentalists. For example, the company has been in regular contact with Envi- ronmental Action Germany (DUH) for several years now. As a result, the company engaged in dialogue regarding refrigerator disposal. Miele vehemently denies one organisation\\u2019s accusa- tions of improper conduct in this area and has presented a large number of audits and reviews of the disposal facilities to back up its rebuttal. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS For years, Miele has supported > FORUM WASCHEN as part of various different pro- jects in order to sensitise consumers and other members of society to more sustain- able washing, dishwashing and cleaning in the household. FORUM WASCHEN offers experts from government authorities, fed- eral ministries, research institutes, unions and manufacturers of detergents and house- hold appliances, as well as technical colleges, environmental organisations, universities and consumer associations, a platform where they can share their knowledge. It also contributes to the public debate surrounding sustainability through conferences, special events and exhi- bitions. In addition to practical input through presentations and lectures by experts, Miele supports the platform financially, for example by organising an annual multipliers\\u2019 meeting. 23  Miele

Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Focus on preventing infection The Covid-19 pandemic was associated with a variety of challenges for Miele as well in the reporting period. Miele responded quickly in early 2020 and launched a com- prehensive set of measures, including a significant expansion of remote working opportunities, the introduction of exclu- sive hygiene concepts, transparent communication for all employees and spe- cific guidance for managers. > Protecting employees and third parties from infec- tion was the top priority at all times during the development of appropriate strategies. COORDINATED APPROACH In February 2020, Miele set up a corona- virus coordination team consisting of senior staff from HR, purchasing, logistics, IT, facility management, communication and the com- pany medical service. This central committee also includes employees who coordinate the approach at the sales subsidiaries and the plants. The team defines necessary measures and recommends them to the Miele locations. The people in charge locally are respon- sible for their implementation in accordance with the statutory requirements. In Germany, those requirements include the protective measures adopted by federal and state gov- ernments. At the same time, the coronavirus coordination team monitors and discusses the latest infection figures. Local crisis teams, which are overseen by the appro- priate management staff at the locations, have been set up to round out the efforts. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY The family-owned company quickly devel- oped and implemented its > own hygiene concepts. In some cases, these concepts were ahead of the official measures or went beyond them. The technical conditions for mobile working were enhanced signif- icantly in a short space of time in order to enable a large portion of the workforce to work from home. In addition, buildings were modified by adding automated opening mechanisms to doors and setting up sepa- rating walls and hand sanitizer dispensers, to name just a few examples. Miele advo- cated for wearing face masks before it became commonplace to do so and for replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual conferences, events and business travel. Moreover, occupational health and safety officers partnered with the company med- ical service to provide advice on events. The company also introduced an occupancy con- cept for offices and meeting rooms to ensure 40 AirControl air purifiers were set up at the G\\u00fctersloh location. FACTS & FIGURES FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS CONTENTS the necessary physical distancing. In produc- tion, employees were newly divided into shift groups, and break times were staggered. To ensure sufficient fresh air in enclosed spaces, Miele developed concepts for ventilation sys- tems. A total of 40 mobile Miele > AirControl air purifiers were also set up at the G\\u00fctersloh location alone in meeting, training and break rooms, as well as at the site\\u2019s company child day-care centre. The G\\u00fctersloh facility man- agement team provided those responsible for facility management at Miele\\u2019s German loca- tions with a central source of knowledge and advice about the concept and other meas- ures. The cafeterias at the locations were subject to strict hygiene requirements in line with the latest official protective measures. The company also offered more flexible working hours in order to ease the burden on parents, who faced particularly daunting challenges during the pandemic due to the closures of day-care centres and schools. Parents also had the option of taking addi- tional time off to take care of their children. The family-owned company started offering testing options at the plant in G\\u00fctersloh and at other Miele production sites at an early stage in order to supplement the public health sys- tem\\u2019s efforts to identify cases of Covid-19. 262626  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Despite increased precautionary and pro- tective measures, multiple cases of Covid-19 occurred among employees at the Miele plant in Euskirchen at the end of February 2021. As a consequence, the employees affected and the people they had been in contact with entered into quarantine. Regular manufacturing operations at the location were suspended until the isolation period had ended. COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORT pandemic, the company faced increased > challenges in this respect during the reporting period. At times, it was not pos- sible to obtain the usual volume of parts from suppliers, and the closure of retail stores cut off the personal connection to customers. In addition, production was interrupted at all plants due to the pandemic-related shortening of working hours in early 2020 \\u2013 and again a year later due to Covid-19 infections at the Euskirchen plant. Never- theless, Miele succeeded in keeping supply risks to a minimum by responding early. Keeping employees up to date at all times and offering them support options has been of the essence throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, Miele informed employees and managers of the latest developments and necessary measures at the locations by e-mail on a regular basis during the reporting period. Employees without personal intranet and company e-mail access had the option to receive important information through a mes- senger service on their smartphones. Miele also set up a Corona Information Center on the intranet with comprehensive infor- mation and an FAQ section. All members of the workforce are invited to contact the corona virus coordination team directly if they have any additional questions. Recom- mended courses of action were provided specifically for management staff on topics such as how to handle suspected cases. Miele offered early testing for employees at some locations to determine the number of Covid-19 infections.

Featuring timelessly elegant > design they are also crafted to be intuitive and as accessible as possible for all users. The company bases its product development activ- ities on sustainability criteria of its own that exceed the legal specifications. There are var- ious areas of focus here, including durability, > recyclability, repairability and the energy and resource efficiency of appliances in real-world use. The aim is to always offer the all-round best appliance on the market. The company works on this in close > dialogue with con- sumers, suppliers and further partners from the industrial and research sectors and from associations. Miele also focuses on coopera- tion when developing innovative new business models relating to sustainability, for example by working with partners such as start-ups. NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS [GRI 203-2] Miele advances numerous pro- jects with promising start-ups in fields such as the smart home, customer support, digital marketing and industry 4.0. Forms of coopera- tion range from joint development projects and management support to direct capital invest- ment. All of Miele\\u2019s involvement in emerging companies to support the traditional line of business takes place under the Miele Ven- ture Capital umbrella. As one example, Miele holds a stake in Plant Jammer, a Danish com- pany. The Plant Jammer app helps consumers use leftover foods creatively. Another example is KptnCook, a Berlin-based start-up that also offers an app having to do with food \\u2013 from indi- vidual recipe inspiration and shopping right up to the finished dish. MChef, based in the German city of Bielefeld, lets customers place online orders for gourmet dishes already plated on high-quality reusable crockery and prepare them conveniently in the Miele Dialog oven, with options for other oven models starting in 2021. Miele Operations & Payment Solutions, a wholly owned Miele subsidiary founded in 2019, developed the appWash concept for shared use of Miele washing machines and tumble dryers, including online reservations and cashless payment. The idea of using appWash to make it easier and more flexible to use and manage appliances provided centrally \\u2013 in larger apart- ment complexes or student housing, for example \\u2013 arose in the smart home area of expertise. The Miele Professional division also relies on partnerships. During the reporting period, a strategic alliance with the medical technology SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling 5.5% of total turnover is invested in research and development. company W&H was launched. Miele and W&H plan to align their product portfolios in the future, each of them incorporating machines from the other partner into its own range. For Miele, that means adding four new tabletop sterilisers from W&H to its product selection. In turn, the washer-disinfectors that W&H now offers come from the Miele plant in Bielefeld. RENTING INSTEAD OF BUYING [GRI 203-2] Under the \\u201cpay-per-use\\u201d model, customers only pay for individual units of output rather than buying an appliance. In the FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS case of a washing machine, for example, one wash cycle would constitute one unit of output. Studies suggest that a pay-per-use approach could promote sustainable con- sumption, not only raising users\\u2019 awareness of efficient use of energy and other resources, but also delivering possible financial savings. After all, someone who pays for each wash cycle is more likely to wait until they have enough laundry to make up a full load instead of running the machine half-empty. In the Netherlands, Miele has been offering a leasing service for washing machines since 2016. The service involves billing users on the basis of their actual use. The low-cost leasing model allows even price-conscious house- holds such as groups of flatmates to conserve resources by using high-quality, efficient appliances. Miele works with Bundles, another start-up, to offer the pro- gramme. When users terminate the leasing contract, the appliance is returned to Bundles and prepared for the next user. EFFICIENT SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Miele offers its customers more than simply high-performance domestic and commercial appliances \\u2013 it increasingly also offers them complete system solutions. These include the appliance itself, useful accessories, the right 2929  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality cleaning agents, smart control and dosing functions and tailor-made service options. Among other things, Miele washing machines and dishwashers are capable of using sensor data to dispense exactly the right amount of detergent. The TwinDos washing machine dosing function unlocks outstanding cleaning results when used with UltraPhase 1 and 2 detergents while also actively helping to pro- tect the environment. As a result, the machine uses only as much detergent as needed, > conserving resources. TwinDos, like the AutoDos function in dishwashers, also allows for smart inventory management, including convenient ordering of replacement supplies of cleaning products via the Miele app (for- merly the Miele@mobile app). For commercial machines, Miele offers cleaning agents under the ProCare brand, also in combina- tion with resource-efficient automatic dosing. Hygiene products are another business segment where Miele offers system solutions. The Professional Business Unit offers facilities such as hotels, nursing homes and medical practices a wide range of system solutions for cleaning and disinfecting crockery, cutlery and instruments. Miele washer-disinfectors and sterilisers process instruments efficiently and safely while also minimising wear and ensuring that they retain their value. If a machine needs service, Miele medical product technicians travel to the site within 24 hours to quickly find a solution. Beyond that, Miele advises business customers on the cost-effective use of efficient washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers in shared facilities such as utility rooms or employee kitchenettes. Miele also offers convenient system solutions in the coffee preparation segment. Depending on the model, coffee machines from Miele feature automatic cleaning and descaling functions for which Miele offers special cartridges. This ensures efficient cleaning, which in turn contributes to the durability of the product. There are also a number of Miele coffee blends available. The coffee is certified fair trade and organic. CONNECTING DOMESTIC APPLIANCES Miele is a leading provider when it comes to connecting domestic appliances. Under the \\u201cMiele@home\\u201d category, the company carries more than 700 different domestic appliance versions with connectivity capa- bility worldwide as part of its portfolio. These appliances revolutionise operation and offer customers added benefits through increased flexibility, convenience, quality of life and > security. Miele created the Smart Home area of expertise in 2017 to serve as a home for all its expertise in this field and drive fur- ther advances in connectivity. The company also founded a subsidiary called Miele Venture Capital, which invests in innovative start-ups. Connected systems already make running a household energy-efficient, secure and convenient. For example, domestic appli- ances can also be controlled conveniently using Amazon\\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assis- tant. Miele customers can use this function to get information about their appliances\\u2019 operating status, control them using voice commands or get explanations of features. New machines, languages and expertise SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION Customer orientation and information EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Disposal and recycling FRESH-PICKED SALAD AND HERBS FROM THE PLANTCUBE Miele entered the vertical farming segment in 2019 with the newly created New Growth Factory Business Unit. \\u201cVertical farming\\u201d is the futuristic term used by researchers for multistorey greenhouses designed to grow food in a compact form close to where it is needed, such as in urban centres. The Plantcube from the Miele subsidiary Agri- lution brings this revolutionary concept home. The fully automated cabinet-style greenhouse is no larger than a standard refrigerator and offers perfect conditions for growing salad, herbs and microgreens \\u2013 seedlings har- vested after just a few days of growth so that they are especially flavourful and rich in nutrients. Growing food this way takes minimal effort, and the harvest is free of pesticides and other environmental influences.

MEASURES TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT in each phase of the product life cycle Connectivity is increasingly unlocking new application scenarios that bring fur- ther advantages in terms of sustainability. Washing assistants integrated into the Miele app provide information on particularly energy-efficient appliance cycles, for example. The AddLoad feature makes it possible to add laundry items that were inadver- tently left out to a load in progress without having to restart the cycle. AddLoad is dis- played on the machine itself and in the Miele app. This lets users see whether it is pos- sible to add laundry to the washing machine, and if so until when, even from a distance. Product development Achievement of the best energy efficiency classes Production Environmental and energy management Use of the optimal technology1) Avoidance of critical substances Consideration of stakeholder requirements In a smart home, appliances from different manufacturers and product categories have to be able to communicate and interact with each other. To accommodate this need, Miele offers an open interface that can be used to integrate Miele@home devices into cross-manufacturer systems and plat- forms. This enables the use of base functions such as start/stop and checking machine status. To drive further advances in com- patibility and interoperability beyond that, Miele is involved in the > EEBus Initiative and > CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization. The goal of these alliances is to establish common standards in electrotechnical areas and for intelligent energy management. The company also tests the interoperability of connected domestic appliances and other building technology components in projects that receive national and international funding. Material selection targets the use of secondary raw materials and high recyclability and therefore high resource efficiency.

In 2018, the com- pany also launched a way for them to use the app to control multiple machines simultane- ously and order replacement detergents. The app provides information on machine status and sends a signal when detergent is run- ning low. MielePro@mobile is now available in six countries, enabling intelligent connec- tivity for Miele ProfiLine dishwashers as well as washing machines and tumble dryers in the > Little Giants model series. The Miele portfolio currently encompasses over 100 commercial machines with connectivity capa- bility that can be linked using the mobile app. Miele offers a remote maintenance function for connected machines to handle software updates that may be necessary. Available updates can be downloaded and installed on the machine in question remotely if the cus- tomer wishes. Starting in 2021, Miele offers users of its premium ovens the ability to pur- chase additional applications and configure them individually, initially limited to Den- mark as a pilot market. These include the Smart Food ID and Smart Browning Control functions, which use cameras to deter- mine food status inside the oven, followed by preparation using automatic programmes. Remote updates make it possible to equip these kinds of Miele appliances with new applications even after years of use. DIGITAL MANAGEMENT FOR COMMERCIAL MACHINES The MielePro@mobile app lets commer- cial customers access their machines from Miele created the Smart Home Professional unit in 2019 to focus on digital innovation management in the commercial solution seg- ment. Smart Home Professional operates the Miele MOVE platform for the company\\u2019s consumers, giving them a source for digital solutions from Miele Professional. Commer- cial users can also visit the platform for a wide range of digital services across different machines to support their day-to-day work. DESIGN Miele\\u2019s design philosophy encompasses ele- gance and aesthetics alongside intuitive, self-explanatory and accessible handling geared towards the needs of all customers. Accordingly, demographic change in indus- trialised nations has already been a key focus for Miele product development for some time. Right from the development of its appliances, the company takes care to ensure that they are easy to use regardless of the user\\u2019s age or physical capabilities. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling This has been a demonstrable success with the KM 7897 FL induction hob, for example. The system automatically recognises the pots and pans placed on the hob, along with changes in position, and adjusts the heat dis- tribution accordingly. The hob received the prestigious iF Design Award and > iF Gold Award 2020 for its easy and intuitive use. The aim of Miele\\u2019s product development activities is to reduce the complexity which people face in everyday life and to ensure that no one is excluded by applying a con- sistent design to all appliances in one product group and using a universal oper- ating logic. The technical term for this is \\u201cuniversal design\\u201d or \\u201cdesign for all\\u201d. Because design is also intended to encourage users to increase their use of the ECO functions to conserve energy and resources, Miele is careful to offer functions that users perceive as helpful and relevant and are happy to use. Specifically, the goal here is to use positive experiences to create a good feeling, solidi- fying sensible user behaviour and achieving the utmost in customer satisfaction. UNIVERSAL DESIGN [GRI 203-2] The rules of universal design ensure that the following performance charac- teristics are incorporated: broad usability, flexibility, simple and intuitive handling, sensory perception of information, fault tolerance, minimum physical effort, convenience and accessibility. Internal guidelines such as the Miele Ergo- nomic Index and the Haptics Guideline form FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS the basis for product design at Miele that has been optimised for ergonomics appeal to the sense of touch. The company aims to make using Miele domestic appliances possible even for the visually impaired. The Miele W1 Guideline, launched in 2017, is the only washing machine on the market that can be retrofitted to allow people with impaired or no vision to operate it. The standard version of this model also offers easy and intuitive use for all users. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST Miele always optimises existing products and develops new ones in keeping with legal requirements and in line with its own stan- dards that go beyond what is required by law. For example, the company also ful- fils the EU-wide Ecodesign Directive, which was revised during the reporting period. This directive on automatic washing machines and washer dryers, for example, sets specific requirements for manufacturers of prod- ucts like washing machines and their washing and rinsing functions. These specifications, which address aspects such as energy effi- ciency, will take effect by stages. Lawmakers have also stipulated repairability requirements to ensure that consumers have the option of obtaining repairs, thereby making it possible to use machines for longer. Producers like Miele are required to provide certain replace- ment parts for seven or ten years, depending on the product and target group, for example. The requirements took effect in March 2021 for the product categories of washing machines, 3232  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality washer-dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators, with further domestic appliances to follow. In order to keep all the key aspects in mind from pre-development to series maturity, Miele works with its in-house IMNU 2.0 product development system. Part of this system is the environmental checklist. It supports development projects with guidelines that show areas of focus that would make sense from an environmental stand- point. The environmental checklist also includes Miele-specific requirements for environmental design, repairability and packaging materials, as well as material specifications relating to things like the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons (PAHs), plasticisers or recycled plastics. These requirements go beyond the legal stipula- tions on the use of chemicals. Another element of the product development system is an inter- national digital rights registry, which provides information on the various legal require- ments that apply to machine development and makes it possible to keep these in mind on a country-specific and product-specific basis. Miele also develops scenarios for individual product categories that make it possible to sys- tematically analyse and regularly review trends and likely developments, including in the context of sustainability. In order to integrate sustain- ability aspects into the product development process right from the start, Miele also pro- duces corresponding life cycle assessments for relevant technological modifications. DIALOGUE FOR SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS [GRI 102-43] Cooperation shortens the path to success, which is why extensive dialogue is especially important to Miele. Various Miele departments and external part- ners work hand in hand during the product development process: The Design Center, marketing and market research teams pinpoint > customer needs, analyse the potential for improving existing appliances and machines and assess the prospects for new products. Designers and developers devote themselves to ideas and concepts. The toolshop, prefabrication and assembly areas cooperate closely with suppliers right from the early phases of development. Employees themselves also frequently supply valuable impetus for lasting improvements. In addition to the corporate suggestion scheme, which was rebranded > \\u201cIdee M\\u201d in 2018, Miele provides employees at many locations with GO IDEA, a database-driven ideas platform. The platform was intro- duced at the G\\u00fctersloh production plant for what is now the Laundry Business Unit in 2015 and later adopted in the Cooking, Small Domestic Appliances and Profes- sional Business Units as well. There are also idea scouts for the various product segments who work on idea develop- ment, manage the decision-making process through a committee and keep employees abreast of new ideas and activities. Supplier expertise is highly sought after, especially when new materials or the chal- lenging field of electromechanics are involved. Regular product innovation workshops held jointly with suppliers help to identify issues that could impact quality early on. External dialogue also contributes to taking future SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION Customer orientation and information EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Disposal and recycling HYGIENICALLY CLEAN LAUNDRY \\u2013 SCIENTIFI CALLY CONFIRMED It all started with a suggestion on the GO IDEA idea platform, which was scientifically reviewed in 2020. The result: certain Miele washing machines eliminate more than 99.9 percent of possible viruses from laundry. This was proven for models with automatic dosing and the \\u201cCotton Hygiene 60\\u00b0C\\u201d cycle as well as the extra \\u201cAllergoWash\\u201d.

With this in mind, Miele engages in regular dialogue with further interest groups and expert part- ners, such as the Oeko-Institut Freiburg. TOGETHER AGAINST MICROPLASTICS istry of Education and Research, which involved representatives of industry, the research sector and environmental asso- ciations. The project focused in particular on solutions in the areas of textile produc- tion and waste water treatment technology that looked at different stages of the tex- tile production chain and life cycle. Miele has watched closely and responded as public discussion surrounding the harmful global environmental impacts of plastic has surged in recent years. One area of special concern here is microplastics (tiny plastic particles and fibres with a diameter of less than 5 millimetres). This subject is espe- cially relevant to Miele, as microplastics can also enter the environment during washing, when they are released from clothing into the waste water system. From there, microplas- tics can find their way into the food chain and be consumed by humans, posing a health risk. Miele has been researching how to prevent or at least sharply reduce microplastics in suds for some time now. Miele washing machines themselves already make a significant contribution towards this aim. Specially designed honeycomb drums and adapted washing programmes handle clothing gently, minimising fibre abrasion. Pre-treatment of fabrics by the textile man- ufacturer offers great potential for reducing microplastics. Filter technologies in washing machines could also help, but economi- cally efficient use of filters is not possible with current technologies. To come up with further solutions, Miele partici- pated in the TextileMission joint research project funded by the German Federal Min- CUSTOMER NEEDS AND FUTURE SCENARIOS [GRI 102-43/-44] Miele market research has been conducting customer and satisfaction surveys in Germany and many other countries for over 30 years. As a result, it receives more than 250,000 consumer opinions every year from across the globe. Miele mines these for informative findings on market perception, pur- chasing decisions and user behaviour. Miele also works in cooperation with national and international market research institutes such as GfK to ensure that its product development activities are conducted on a firm footing. Direct contact with consumers is an integral part of the work done by Miele designers. At the G\\u00fctersloh site, for example, Miele has its own test studio which is used to perform us - ability tests. Here, a representative selection of consumers is given the opportunity to exten- sively test new domestic appliances. Working with consumer associations is another impor- tant factor. For example, Miele development teams work closely with the German Fed- eration of the Blind and Partially Sighted to design accessible products. They also develop future scenarios based on trend analyses, user models and the latest user experience (UX) methods, as well as observations and SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling surveys. These scenarios help the company identify the needs of tomorrow early on and address them in its development activities. Together with other companies that do research, Miele crafts visions of a digitalised and more sustainable life. Toward this aim, Miele Smart Home teamed up with Z_Punkt and the architecture firm Graft in early 2020 to launch the > FuturePIX initiative. In cooperation with further companies, two workshops have been held to develop an initial shared image of urban space in Europe for the year 2030. The initiative aims to combine the expertise of the various participating companies to assess the changes that are on the horizon for people\\u2019s living environments and use this as a source of insight for corporate strategies, new business segments and lines of business for participating stakeholders. During the reporting period, Miele also worked on innovative solutions for its own processes. These activities focused on the digital transformation of customer service, with customers\\u2019 possible future expectations as one area of analysis. Over 30 years of Miele market research FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 3434  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality Long service life, low consumption From day one, the core of the Miele product philosophy has been to offer its customers products of exceptional quality and with a particularly long service life. As a com- pany focused on sustainability, Miele also pays great attention to energy effi- ciency. More than three-quarters of the energy that domestic and commercial appliances need from development to dis- posal is consumed during the > usage phase. Miele adopts a holistic approach here too. In addition to energy demand, water consumption and the use of chemi- cals such as detergents also play a major role in relation to potential conservation. All Miele appliances are designed with maximum efficiency in mind under real conditions. For example, they feature a range of > consumption-reducing functions. Addi- tional potential for conserving resources is opened up by connectivity and incorporation into smart home concepts. In this process, Miele makes sure that low consumption does not come at the expense of practical benefit \\u2013 for example with respect to programme duration, > noise levels and the results achieved when cooking, cleaning, washing and vacuuming. ENERGY LABEL REFORM During the reporting period, the compa- ny\\u2019s areas of focus included the > reform of the energy label and providing associ- ated > information to customers. The new EU product label is intended to help con- sumers purchase energy-efficient large domestic appliances. A revised scale from A to G \\u2013 which initially applies to washing machines, washer-dryers, dishwashers, refrig- erators and freezers and wine storage units \\u2013 has been in effect since 1 March 2021. The previous A+++, A++ and A+ classes have been eliminated. Beyond that, more-realistic methods of measuring energy consump- tion and determining the label class were introduced in some areas. The new legis- lation was specifically drafted to ensure that few products, if any, are assigned to the highest label classes for some time to come. Because new calculation methods were applied, the old scale and the new one are not comparable. For example, refrigerators and freezers that previously fell within the old labelling scheme\\u2019s most efficient classes, from A+++ to A, may now be rated C to F, even with no change in energy consumption.

WASHING MACHINES [GRI 302-5] In the business year 2020, all Miele washing machines sold in the EU fell within what was then the best energy label class, A+++. Beyond that, the proportion of washing machines that consume at least 10 percent less energy than is required to be included in the best energy efficiency class (depending on the model) has increased significantly in recent years. The figure stood at 82 percent in the business year 2020 (2019: 72 percent). Under the energy label requirements that took effect in March 2021, almost all front loader models are rated for the new best energy effi- ciency class, A, thanks to their innovative, highly efficient technology. The only model to come in second best, with a B rating, is the entry-level model with a load capacity of 7 kilogrammes. Top loaders fall in energy efficiency class C. Miele systematically develops its domestic and commercial appliances further by giving consider- ation to the entire product life cycle. As the scope for achieving further improvements in efficiency is getting smaller and smaller, the need for smart solutions is high. For this reason, Miele introduced the SingleWash programme in 2018. This pro- gramme improves the environmental performance of the washing machines when a very light load is used. Unfortunately, light loads are becoming more and more common in daily life, previously resulting in high energy demands. By using this programme, the washing machine uses 60 percent less energy and 51 percent less water compared with conventional automatic load detection. In addition, the cycle is also reduced by 59 percent. Some Miele household models even offer an addi- tional connection for hot water, rain or well water. Using solar-heated hot water, for example, makes it possible to reduce electricity consumption by a further 35 percent compared to the use of cold tap water. The new Little Giants commercial model series introduced in early 2019 includes washing machines and tumble dryers that use as much as 22 percent less water and 28 percent less elec- tricity compared with the previous generation. 100% of Miele washing machines sold in 2020 reach the highest efficiency class available on the market. Washing machine operation is continuously being adjusted to reflect customers\\u2019 current needs and requirements. The large M Touch user interface is as intuitive, easy and quick to use as a smart- phone. The white script on black background that is typical of Miele appliances is also highly legible. The size of the touch display also contributes to ease of handling.

Since washer dryers are frequently used for washing alone, the new label has two parts. testing by Stiftung Warentest (tested 09/2020). It was the only model to earn the highest rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d, putting it well ahead of the sec- ond-ranked contender. The Miele appliance stood out from the rest in the testing criteria of drying, handling and environmental properties in particular. The new Little Giants commer- cial tumble dryer generation also includes a model featuring heat pump technology. All Miele washer dryers have the highest energy efficiency rating, A, for their wash cycles. That is true of both the old energy label and the new one. The washing and drying programme achieves energy efficiency class D under the new labelling scheme. TUMBLE DRYERS [GRI 302-5] In the case of tumble dryers, the percentage of appliances with the previous best energy efficiency rating, A+++, rose signif- icantly in the reporting period, from 52 percent in 2019 to 59 percent in 2020. The fact that the particularly efficient heat pump technology has been introduced onto the market played a crucial role in this. Thanks to further techno- logical developments, the new top model \\u201cT1 Passion\\u201d surpassed the limit value of A+++ by 10 percent. The EcoDry technology with particularly effective filter system and mainte- nance-free heat exchanger ensures low energy consumption and short drying times on a long- term basis. The shift to R290 refrigerant also marks a big step forward in moving toward a tumble dryer range without chlorofluorocar- bons. Seventy-six percent of the tumble dryers with heat pump sold in Europe in 2020 were already equipped with this climate-friendlier refrigerant. In 2020, the Miele heat pump tumble dryer TEB 155 WP emerged the only winner in DISHWASHERS [GRI 302-5] Miele introduced the G 7000 series back in 2018. Its AutoDos system with inte- grated PowerDisk dispenses the detergent according to the programme selected or \\u2013 in automatic mode \\u2013 according to the level of dirt. This makes cleaning particularly efficient as overdosing of detergent is prevented. Fur- ther refinements were also made in mobile > control via app for greater convenience and ease. In some countries, Amazon\\u2019s voice assis- tant > Alexa is also available for this purpose. This means that customers can, for example, start and stop their dishwasher from anywhere, check fill levels or order detergent online. In all, the percentage of dishwashers with the previous best energy efficiency rating rose during the reporting period, climbing from 44 percent in 2019 to 51 percent in 2020. Miele launched the new generation of under-countertop tank dishwashers in the PTD 70x model series during the reporting period for superior efficiency in profes- sional dishwashing applications. The narrow glass cleaning model in particular is much more resource-efficient, with standard pro- SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling grammes using just 2 litres of water to rinse and the Eco programme lowering the figure still further, to 1.8 litres. This represents a saving of 17 and 25 percent, respectively, over the previous generation. The other three models in this series use 8 to 17 percent less water. This is achieved through opti- mised water routing and redesigned spray arms. Because the system uses less water, it also needs less energy and detergent. VACUUM CLEANERS [GRI 302-5] Since 2017, the Ecodesign Reg- ulation for Vacuum Cleaners has restricted the power of vacuum cleaners to a max- imum of 900 watts and placed higher demands on dust suction and noise reduc- tion. At the heart of the Miele vacuum cleaner is a highly efficient fan with up to 25 percent better effectiveness than its pre- decessor. Together with various > appliance optimisations and appropriate accesso- ries, such as the fine dust Miele HyClean 3D Efficiency dustbag, this fan ensures the cleaning performance is constantly high with significantly lower energy consumption. Efficient floorheads also play an impor- tant role here, as they can achieve top-class cleaning results even with low wattage and low power settings. Vacuum cleaners with EcoTeQ floorheads made up 17 percent of those sold in the EU in 2020. The high per- formance capacity of these machines with 550 watts has also been confirmed by testing institutes. In early 2021, Stiftung Warentest named a model from the EcoLine series (550 watts) the winner in its test, with the top mark of 2.0 (tested 02/2021).

Beyond that, many Miele appliances are equipped with a range of functions and fea- tures that allow users to tap into further potential for savings. ECO FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES APPLIANCES AND FEATURES How it works EcoFeedback (dishwashers) With the EcoFeedback function, users have the current consumption values of their dishwasher under control. Even before the cycle starts, they receive a forecast on the water and electricity consumption for the select- ed programme. They can therefore find out at a glance, for example, that a programme operating at a longer cycle time or lower temperature will require less energy. At the end of the programme, the appliance displays the actual consumption in kilowatt-hours and litres.

All programmes and functions undergo continuous improvement to reduce consumption and achieve superior efficiency in real-world use. 3939  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality and research confirm that this is also worth- while from an ecological perspective (> UBA 2016, > \\u00d6ko-Institut 2015, > \\u00d6ko-Institut 2018). 5,600 programme cycles is what a Miele dishwasher must deliver during testing. DURABILITY: ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL PRODUCT SERVICE LIFE MIELE APPLIANCES REMAIN A PART OF THE HOME FOR LONGER In order to benefit from the ecological advan- tages of durability, however, the appliances must be used by consumers for long enough. In fact, Miele domestic appliances are used in the home for longer than appliances from other manufacturers before they are either sold on or replaced due to a defect. This has been repeat- edly confirmed in several studies in the past. In a survey, Stiftung Warentest discovered that users of Miele tumble dryers mentioned rel- atively few issues and faults compared with competitor products, even with appliances as old as 20 years or more (tested 09/2018). Miele is the only manufacturer in the industry that tests its products to last up to 20 years. The requirements that appliances must sat- isfy in these tests are defined in a separate plant standard. For washing machines and washer dryers for household use, Miele assumes five programme cycles a week, or 5,000 over 20 years. Commercial machines also undergo service life testing. For example, Miele calculates two programme cycles per day for cleaning and disinfection devices in the PG 85 series, which works out to more than 15,000 hours of operation over 20 years. This exceptional durability of Miele prod- ucts is the result of sturdy construction, the use of high-quality materials and demanding load and endurance tests. Various surveys Customer satisfaction is a factor that is not to be underestimated when it comes to ensuring that domestic appliances are used for as long as possible. If a domestic appliance does its job reliably and delivers the results, user con- venience, energy efficiency and design that customers ask for, a functioning appliance will very rarely be replaced early. As a result, key tasks for product development activities at Miele include > timeless design, good repairability and the ability to update control software to the latest version later on. The current brand loyalty con- firms the success of this strategy. According to Stiftung Warentest, more than 70 percent of people who use a Miele washing machine or tumble dryer would opt for a Miele appliance again. More than 77 percent would \\u201cdefinitely\\u201d recommend Miele tumble dryers (test 04/2018). SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling NEW SOFTWARE FOR OLDER APPLIANCES The increasing importance of software in domestic appliances offers the oppor- tunity to improve functions over the long utilisation phase of Miele appliances or to adapt them to new requirements. Thanks to standardised diagnostic support from authorised Miele service partners, soft- ware improvements can be installed not just on new appliances, but also on those that have already been produced. The company also introduced a remote main- tenance function in 2020, which has already made it possible to optimise or expand the software in domestic appliances in many countries around the world from a distance. GOOD REPAIRABILITY Miele domestic appliances are renowned for their reliability. Nevertheless, over the course of a long appliance life, faults may occur that require the assistance of the service team. In order to keep customer costs low in such cases, the appliances are designed to be \\u201crepair-friendly\\u201d. This means that as little effort as possible should be required to repair or replace a component. As Miele assumes a service life of up to 20 years for its products, its supply of spare parts is organised gener- ously. Around 70,000 different original Miele spare parts are therefore permanently held in stock at the central warehouse in G\\u00fcter- sloh. From there, they are then dispatched as required to locations all over the world and are available for many years after produc- tion of the particular appliance has ceased. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS GENTLE TREATMENT OF TEXTILES AND CROCKERY Durability in the broader sense of the word also includes the gentle treatment of textiles and the care of valuable cutlery and crockery in the dishwasher. In the case of washing machines, shorter programme durations, for example, protect the laundry and extend the life of the garments. Special detergents can also extend the life span of products. With this in mind, Miele introduced process chem- icals that are especially gentle on materials in its ProCare series during the reporting period. These phosphate-free, microplastic-free prod- ucts for commercial dishwashers and washing machines carry the EU Ecolabel. This seal of quality is used for products and services that are more ecofriendly than standard products. PRODUCT SAFETY: EXTENSIVE TESTING [GRI 416-1] As a general rule, all Miele prod- ucts are extensively tested with respect to health and safety risks to the consumer. Compliance with product safety aspects is tested and certified by independent bodies such as VDE, DEKRA or T\\u00dcV, and the prod- ucts are certified accordingly. In addition to laws and standards, in-house Miele stand- ards apply in certain areas, and in some cases have significantly more stringent requirements with respect to product safety. Extensive tests and service life inspec- tions also contribute to product safety as do findings from customer service callouts. In an industry comparison, Miele achieves a very high level of vertical integration of up to 50 percent depending on the product. This 4040  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality helps the company to differentiate the core components from the competition, strongly influencing the quality of these components, and therefore also enhancing product safety. Ensuring product safety is also a process that involves several areas, as Corporate Regu- latory Affairs (SRA), the design/development departments and Quality Management all work in close cooperation with each other. Certain sources of faults are carefully identified and assessed using targeted, global market mon- itoring, customer service feedback, product recalls, or spare parts sales (field monitoring). Influences from modified user behaviour can also be identified in this way. An additional factor is preventive quality work, which accompanies new products as early as the product develop- ment phase with the aid of test series and can therefore have an influence at an early stage. 70,000 spare parts are kept in stock up to 15 years after production of the particular appliance series. the countries where the products are distrib- uted. For example, this includes the full and reproducible documentation of each individual batch of sterile products as a matter of course. MEETING HIGH HYGIENE STANDARDS Miele\\u2019s professional commercial laundry appli- ances offer special programmes to suit the particular hygiene requirements of establish- ments such as retirement homes, hospitals or hotels. The same is true of fresh water com- mercial dishwashers, which meet significantly higher hygiene standards than models with a tank system, as fresh water is used for each rinse cycle. They also offer special programmes with high final rinse temperatures (up to more than 93\\u00b0C) and long temperature holding times. This combination of high temperatures and long holding times produces particularly hygienic cleaning results. The hygiene requirements in the medical technology sector are even higher. As a certified medical product manufacturer, Miele meets all statutory hygiene standards of A new series of CUBE-X sterilisers available since autumn 2019 offers processes that meet par- ticularly stringent hygiene standards for various loads, such as hollow medical instruments used in settings such as dentists\\u2019 offices. These prod- ucts do not require maintenance until five years or 4,000 cycles into their service life \\u2013 much later than comparable devices from competitors. In addition, Miele launched the Miele AirCon- trol air purifier series on the market in January 2021. These machines filter all of the air in a room up to 200 square meters in size six times an hour, using five levels of filtration to trap floating particles, viruses, bacteria and mould. The air purifiers are especially suitable for use in meeting rooms, childcare facili- ties, classrooms and retail outlets. When used in tandem with other hygiene measures, they can help to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling STRICT STANDARDS FOR POLLUTANT-FREE PRODUCTS [GRI 102-11] As a matter of principle, Miele avoids the use of critical substances, wher- ever possible. Before any substances are used, Miele establishes whether they are considered critical by experts, and whether there are reasons to avoid them relating to the environment and/or human health. To this end, the use of critical substances is restricted by specifications that apply throughout the company, such as Miele\\u2019s own company standards. Compliance with rel- evant legal standards is second nature to Miele. Such standards include, for example, the EU chemicals regulation (REACH) and the EU directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances (RoHS). Compliance is monitored through analysis of products and components. EMISSIONS AND INDOOR CLIMATE Miele appliances are optimised in every conceiv- able way so that emissions like noise, odours and moisture are also kept to a minimum. For example, Miele dishwashers and cooker hoods are among the quietest products on the market. Even in open-plan kitchens, the operating noises are not regarded as a nuisance. Another advantage of this is that dishwashers, for example, can be operated outside of electricity peaks and at off-peak tariffs, where applicable. Miele tumble dryers operate highly efficiently and produce the lowest condensate losses compared with competitor products. As a result, they release a particularly low amount FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS of moisture into the ambient air. This is advan- tageous both in terms of energy efficiency and for health reasons, as excessive air humidity can lead to mould formation in rooms without sufficient ventilation. During the cold winter months, however, ventilating indoor spaces results in significant heat loss, which can only be addressed by turning up the heat and thus using more energy. Miele cooker hoods and ovens are equipped with filters or catalysers (depending on the model for ovens) to min- imise odours while also preventing greasy vapours from entering the ambient air. Miele\\u2019s goal is to curb emissions in floor care as well, which is why Miele vacuum cleaners have multi-stage filtration systems. Depending on the model, examples include HEPA filters, which trap microscopic particles and allergens. Thanks to their sustainable properties, Miele machines were selected for a very special pro- ject in Denmark. Miele is a standard equipment provider involved in designing Denmark\\u2019s very first \\u201cgreen city\\u201d. Between now and 2024, sus- tainable housing and work space is being created in Copenhagen\\u2019s Carlsberg district. The G\\u00fctersloh-based manufacturer is sup- plying some 15,000 domestic appliances for the project, in which sustainability takes centre stage across every area of domestic life, from timeless design and carbon neutrality to the long life spans of Miele appliances. 4141  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Customer orientation and information Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Customer orientation and information Ensuring maximum customer satisfaction For Miele, meeting the expectations of its customers when it comes to products and services \\u2013 and even exceeding them where possible \\u2013 is of the utmost importance. Long-term partnerships with retailers are one important factor in this. Miele appliances are sold in Germany, Europe and abroad through authorised dealers and by Miele itself. The company uses this approach to ensure high quality when it comes to marketing as well. In 2020, Miele supplied over 12,500 author- ised dealers in Germany. These dealers adopt the same high demands for quality in terms of presentation, range of products and services, consultation skills and cus- tomer services. Miele and its partners apply the same standards in e-commerce as well. As sustainability is becoming increasingly important to consumers, Miele provides transparent information on the sustain- able design and use of its products. GROWING INTEREST IN SUSTAINABILITY [GRI 417-1/-2] In many countries, Miele is registering a growing interest in sus- tainability among customers, especially with respect to consumption. Efficiency values for electricity, water and gas have become a key argument when it comes to making decisions to purchase, as feed- back from dealers and customer surveys show. Miele uses various channels of communication to inform its customers about sustainability, including informa- tion provided on the product (EU energy consumption labelling), operating instruc- tions, product brochures and consultations with dealers and in showrooms around the world, as well as international trade fairs. Corporate communications and the com- pany website also contain information on sustainability aspects. Information on the proper > disposal and > safe operation of machines is prominently featured in various locations. Incorrect or inadequate infor- mation on this subject could have negative consequences for people and the environ- ment. Miele uses the Sustainability Report, for example, to report on matters such as where the components of its products come from and whether recycled materials are used. Communication about sustainability reaches customers, together with informa- tion about the good reputation of the Miele brand. In representative studies conducted by the Miele market research team from 2019 to the first quarter of 2021, the majority of the approximately 54,000 respon dents in 15 European countries confirmed that Miele supports a sustainable lifestyle. Over 12,500 authorised dealers for Miele domestic appliances and commercial machines FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS There were no relevant incidents of non-compliance with regulations or rules of conduct relating to product and service information and labelling during the reporting period. EXTENDED WARRANTIES AVAILABLE From material defects to manufacturing errors, Miele\\u2019s two-year manufacturer warranty means > repairs are free of charge for customers. For added peace of mind, customers can extend the war- ranty to five or ten years as long as it has not yet expired. Miele teamed up with an insurance partner in 2018 to offer an extended warranty service, pro- viding full coverage for appliances that are already out of warranty, where the extended warranty is expiring soon or that are already ten years old or more. The \\u201cMiele Service Zertifikat Plus\\u201d package comes with a monthly fee. This is one way Miele is doing its part to extend the period of application of its appliances and thereby conserve resources. The service has been very well received by customers, with over 25,000 contracts concluded in 2020 \\u2013 about 1,000 more than the previous year. 4242  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality AFTER-SALES CUSTOMER SERVICE Miele employs approximately 2,500 ser- vice technicians who regularly undergo rigorous training and complete their ser- vice calls with the help of extensively equipped service vans. The \\u201cfirst-call completion rate\\u201d (percentage of service requests complete after the first service call) for Miele Service is 80 to 85 per- cent globally. In Germany, a rate of over 90 percent has already been achieved. DETAILED CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR RECALL CAMPAIGNS [GRI 416-2] Despite Miele\\u2019s high quality standards, recall campaigns may become necessary in certain very rare instances. Detailed contingency plans are in place for this, with the names of the persons respon- sible for taking prompt action. Experiences from such recalls are thoroughly analysed and considered for future developments. There were no recall campaigns during the reporting period. VIRTUAL INTERIOR PLANNING It allows customers to see what \\u201ctheir\\u201d kitchen would look like in advance. Solutions like this one are mainly offered and promoted by kitchen design software manufacturers. SENSITIVE HANDLING OF CUSTOMER DATA [GRI 418-1] Miele views protecting the > Miele@home infrastructure and secure handling of customer data as extremely important. Trust in Miele must also be secured, even in an interconnected world. With this in mind, the company takes a whole host of precautions, utilises state- of-the-art encryption methods and works tirelessly in conjunction with external spe- cialists to make further improvements to the security architecture. In addition to the EU General Data Protection Regu- lation (GDPR), the Miele privacy policy, rolled out in 2018, sets out rules on han- dling of digital data, especially customer data. There were no substantiated com- plaints regarding data protection or privacy infringements among customers in the reporting period. There were also no cases of data theft or loss of customer data. The collection, storage, processing and use of all personal customer data are per- formed according to data protection rules. Many people would like to plan and deco- rate their household individually and consider vari ous options as quickly, realistically and easily as possible. As a result, Miele is increasingly focusing on digital presentation and planning for various product configu- rations and providing the necessary data for them to do so. Virtual reality is increas- ingly important in the visualisation of kitchen designs at kitchen and furniture stores.

CARE TIPS FOR LONG APPLIANCE LIFE Miele appliances are known for their superior durability and reliability. But even high-quality products require proper care \\u2013 something that could help to avoid some service cases. In France, Miele launched a campaign on this topic. The campaign included a brochure containing care tips, information at retail locations (via QR codes, for example) and online tutorials on social media. The dura- bility and repairability of domestic appliances are viewed as very important in France. As a result, the campaign generated a very positive response and will be continued. CONTENTS 4343  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality AWARDS FOR QUALITY AND SERVICE Various awards repeatedly confirm the reliability of Miele\\u2019s appliances and customer service. These include the following from the reporting period: At the Domestic Appliance Awards organised by the consultancy firm Kantar, Miele received top marks in the cate- gory of customer satisfaction in 2019 across all the markets studied (Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Spain) and across all product categories.

FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 4444  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Disposal and recycling Environmentally responsible treatment of old appliances Once a Miele product reaches the end of its typical long useful life, the next step is to send it for recycling or for further disposal via a return system. This is why Miele actively works on continuously improving the return systems. The company\\u2019s special focus here is on the areas of logistics and protecting the environment. Miele also engages with con- sumers in particular through various channels, initiatives and campaigns, sharing informa- tion on how to properly return old appliances for environmentally responsible disposal. FURTHER ENHANCING RECYCLABILITY Making sure an appliance is recyclable down the line is a factor as early as during > product development. For example, Miele works with waste management compa- nies and operators of treatment plants to study the potential effects on disposal or ini- tial treatment and recycling of appliances at the end of a product\\u2019s life. Both domestic and commercial appliances from Miele are characterised by a very high level of recy- clability. This is achieved through various means, including careful selection of mate- rials and bonding techniques. For example, the company is careful to use plastics of the same type frequently in order to make recy- cling easier or even possible in the first place. To facilitate disassembly and separation, the number of different material types and screw varieties is also kept to a minimum. Wherever it may be possible and practical without affecting quality, Miele investigates whether secondary or alternative, more recy- clable materials can be used. One important area is packaging for cleaning and care prod- ucts. Miele has the recyclability of some of its plastic packaging tested and assessed by external institutes. Experts from Miele and waste management companies also jointly conduct practical tests on selected packaging types to ensure that the materials used are easy to separate and then sort for recycling. In December 2019, Miele specialists visited a disposal partner in Porta Westfalica, Germany. While there, they discussed current topics in the field of packaging and took a guided tour of the sorting facility for lightweight pack- aging materials. The group was especially interested in the opportunity to see a spe- cial technology used to separate multilayer packages via near-infrared spectroscopy. CLOSING THE LOOP [GRI 301-2] In May 2018, the European Council adopted a circular economy package that has shaped development SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling and production activities at Miele to a sig- nificant degree since then. It includes changes in multiple waste-specific direc- tives, including for packaging, and has now been incorporated into many laws at the national level. It also makes possible fur- ther steps towards achieving a fully circular economy. Miele supports these plans and has implemented various projects to recycle components from old Miele appliances Miele is also increasingly focusing on circular models to boost the use of recycled and recyclable materials. The product category of vacuum cleaners and accessories offers one example. In 2020, the company began producing one brush, two heads and one dusting brush from post-consumer recycled plastic. This means the plastic was previ- ously used by consumers and then recycled. At the same time, the family-owned com- pany supports different projects aimed at promoting the circular economy. One of them is the WEEE-Harz project, which is receiving funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The pro- ject is studying how a sustainable circular economy for electrical appliances can be developed in Germany\\u2019s Harz region. Miele also began working with other producers FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS and stakeholders in the disposal industry in the Dialogforum effiziente Kreislaufwirtschaft (Efficient Circular Economy Dialogue Forum) in 2020 to help further improve the infor- mation system for efficient recycling. RESPONSIBLE RETURNS AND DISPOSAL [GRI 301-3] Throughout the world, Miele strives to ensure that its materials are recy- cled in an environmentally friendly manner along the entire waste management chain, and support the fight against illegal trade involving waste electrical appliances. In the EU, the return and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment is regu- lated by the WEEE Directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive). The Electrical and Electronic Equipment Act (ElektroG) transposes the provisions of the WEEE Directive into German law. The body in charge of its implementation is the German national register for waste electric equipment (known as stiftung ear). Among other things, it is responsible for registering manufac- turers, coordinating the provision of collection containers by manufacturers and arranging to pick up old appliances at transfer points set up by municipalities.

In other EU countries, Miele uses similar \\u2013 and in some cases state-run \\u2013 return and recycling systems, such as Recupel in Belgium, Eco-syst\\u00e8mes in France and UFH in Austria. Outside the EU, Miele makes use of the established disposal systems already in place. The \\u201cE-Waste Recycling\\u201d association is responsible for collecting and disposing of old electronics in Russia. It was founded by manufacturers in 2017 and has since devel- oped disposal standards and an audit system to monitor recycling companies. Beyond that, Miele also works on the fur- ther development and harmonization of disposal standards. For example, the com- pany participated in May 2020 in a workshop as part of the European Commission\\u2019s study on > quality standards for the treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Miele was also involved in the development of the EN 50614:2020 standard, published in 2020. This standard sets out uniform requirements for preparing to reuse waste electrical and electronic equipment. The goal is to ensure that it is possible to reuse appliances that are still usable or their com- ponents, even within the waste management regime itself. Across all of Miele\\u2019s activities in this area, the overarching goal is to ensure product safety for consumers while estab- lishing uniform competitive conditions and standards for the stakeholders involved. 4646  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality RETURNS OF OLD APPLIANCES [GRI 301-3] In Germany, the ElektroG (2015, amended in 2021) requires manufacturers, local authorities, brick-and-mortar dealers and online distributors with a sales area or storage/ dispatch area of 400 square metres or more to accept the return of old appliances. Miele offers to accept returns of old appliances of the same type when a new appliance is purchased online as well. Beyond that, small appliances with external dimensions of less than 25 cen- timetres can be returned free of charge, whether or not a new one is purchased. In cooperation with the return service provider WEEE Return, small appliances returned to Miele are handled and recycled properly. > Miele dealers are also important partners. When buying a new appliance, customers can state whether they would like to have the dealer dispose of the old one. When the new product is delivered, the dealer takes the registered old appliance and delivers it either to a municipal collection point or directly to initial handling and recycling. The quantities that have been taken back and disposed of by manufacturers via stiftung ear have continued to rise sharply over the past few years, from just under 80,000 pickups in 2018 to over 90,000 in 2020. The increase is likely due to the effects of the expanded scope of the law (open scope) and other trends, such as the shift towards battery-powered appli- ances and devices. Increased consumer purchasing power and an uptick in pri- vate domestic appliance disposal due to the Covid-19 pandemic may also be fac- tors here. The total return requirement for providers in the appliance categories/col- lection groups is calculated based on the quantities brought into circulation. In the 2020 calendar year, Miele accepted returns of more than 12,350 tonnes of old appli- ances in the relevant categories across Germany on instructions from stiftung ear. RECLAIMED PACKAGING [GRI 301-3] As part of its legal obliga- tions, Miele also ensures that packaging is reclaimed in Germany. In keeping with an industry solution developed by manufac- turers of domestic appliances and of kitchen furnishings and accessories, the company has transport packaging materials picked up and disposed of properly by a shared disposal service provider and its subcontrac- tors. Sales packaging and outer packaging, which typically constitutes waste after the appliances are used by customers, are col- lected in Germany via the \\u201cdual system\\u201d. Miele engages in dialogue on this point with waste management companies and recycling and environmental technology engineering companies to identify potential ways to improve the recyclability of its packaging. Annual package disposal activities give rise to greenhouse gas emissions by waste man- agement companies, which are offset by climate action projects. For the business year 2019, Miele\\u2019s partner offset 512 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in the transportation packaging segment, and the relevant emis- sion reduction certificates were retired. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling Miele is working with experts to make packaging even more recyclable by design. POLLUTANTS DURING DISPOSAL [GRI 305-6/-7, 416-1] The aim of proper dis- posal is to make substances that carry health risks or are harmful to the environ- ment as innocuous as possible. One example of this type of pollutant involves refrigerants and insulants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs are multiple times > more harmful to the environment than CO2. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Older refrigeration equipment, including refrigerators, often still contains CFCs. The law requires manufacturers to recover CFCs to the greatest extent possible at the dis- posal stage. Miele meets these obligations as part of a manufacturing consortium which includes its specialised service providers. The DIN EN 50625-2-3 standard and TS 50625-3-4 specifications are explicitly part of the contracts with waste management 4747  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality companies and also apply to participating subcontractors. The methods and treatment facilities involved, along with their opera- tors, are also subject to stringent permitting requirements and checks by supervisory authorities in Germany. Miele also partici- pates in joint external audits via a consortium of manufacturers and obligates its disposal service providers to undergo audits of their treatment facilities for refrigeration equip- ment by a research institution approved to perform this kind of testing. The double audit system means that each treatment facility undergoes an average of four audits a year. The audit process includes various esca- lation levels in case any deviations from the standards are found. Immediate meas- ures can often remedy any problems. In the case of critical deviations, the last resort is to halt deliveries to the facility in question until a subsequent audit has been performed and the necessary measures have been accepted by the testing body. Recycling facil- ities are also subject to regular leakproofing tests (100-device test under the German Technical Instructions on Air Quality Con- trol (TA Luft)) and 1,000-device performance tests. Facility operators are additionally required to perform checks of their own. and has negative consequences for the environment. Consumers also share in the responsibility for making it difficult to col- lect waste illegally. As a result, Miele helps its customers to dispose responsibly of old appliances and transport packaging by pro- viding information in the appliance operating instructions and on the > miele-website. In 2020, the company also participated in the Germany-wide > \\u201cPlan E\\u201d consumer infor- mation campaign organized by stiftung ear. This campaign aims to raise aware- ness among consumers of how to properly return old appliances. The sales subsidiary in India operates an e-waste initiative to raise customers\\u2019 awareness of environmentally responsible recycling of old appliances and build a recycling supply chain to handle these products. Other sales subsidiaries offer dis- counts on new products. In the United Arab Emirates, for instance, consumers received a discount in 2019 when purchasing a vacuum cleaner if they returned their old vacuum cleaner \\u2013 no matter the brand \\u2013 to Miele. DISPOSAL OF MATERIALS RAISING CONSUMER AWARENESS OF RETURNS OF OLD APPLIANCES [GRI 417-1] It is not uncommon for elec- trical and electronic devices to be collected and resold illegally, for example in street campaigns, without the appropriate per- mits. This undermines the importance of the proper disposal of hazardous substances [GRI 417-1] New products, too, are tested with a view to their future disposal. Particular attention is paid to insulation materials, which help to lower the energy consumed by refrig- erators. For example, the process of breaking down vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) can give rise to particulates, which could cause prob- lems at the recycling plants if disposal is not carried out properly and the exhaust system is not designed correctly. However, research carried out by the European home appli- ance trade association APPLiA (previously SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling known as CECED) showed that if the plants are adequately impermeable and the filter systems are appropriate, then operations should run without any notable problems. TRANSPARENT LABELLING [GRI 417-1] The manufacturers organized within > APPLiA support waste manage- ment companies in doing their jobs properly. With this goal in mind, they have drafted codes of conduct on \\u201cend of life\\u201d labelling of appliances that contain VIPs and those containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, with Miele participating in a committee role. These voluntary pledges call for standard- ised labelling on the back of refrigerators, among other points. This is intended to make it possible to identify critical insulation materials and refrigerants, optimising envi- ronmentally responsible disposal. APPLiA and DIGITALEUROPE also operate the > I4R online information platform (Informa- tion for Recyclers). This website provides waste management companies and other interested parties with recycling information for various types of appliance directly from the manufacturer, including information on hazardous substances and components.

PRODUCTS & SERVICES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS CONTENTS 4949  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Natural resources and materials Efficient use of resources It takes natural resources and materials from all over the world to produce Miele appliances, from stainless steel for washing machines to plastic granulate for vacuum cleaners and glass ceramics for hobs. By the time these items arrive at the Miele locations, they have already undergone a multitude of process steps. Different sustainability considera- tions apply to these upstream value creation stages, depending on the material. Many nat- ural resources are only available in limited supply, even though demand is rising around the world. As resources become scarcer as a result, long-term availability and supply secu- rity are becoming increasingly important and posing more and more of a challenge. Miele is rising to this challenge. The > efficient use of materials and respon- sible handling of natural resources are key objectives and have been a firm fix- ture of the Miele strategy for years. In addition, Miele places great value on making the origins of materials and resources clear. Miele carries out regular checks to ensure that its direct suppliers are complying with > environmental and social standards. Hotspot analysis is carried out for individual components as and when necessary, such as if certain ecological or social risks are sus- pected in the natural resources supply chain. The various life cycle phases of the compo- nent are investigated with regard to specific sustainability issues. Despite Miele\\u2019s exten- sive efforts in this regard, it is currently not possible for the company to ensure com- plete traceability of all materials, given the globalised procurement markets and complex supply chains. However, direct sup- pliers are contractually obliged to confirm to Miele that their upstream suppliers are asked to comply with SA8000 standards. USE OF RESOURCES AND MATERIALS [GRI 102-9, 301-1/2] Miele obtains raw mate- rials such as stainless steel or plastic granulate, as well as components such as hoses and ball bearings, to manufacture its products. Entire products such as refrigerators, automatic coffee machines or microwave ovens are also sup- plied by > external manufacturing partners in accordance with Miele\\u2019s specifications. In the business year 2020, Miele obtained materials, components and domestic appli- ances with a value of around EUR 1.6 billion (2019: EUR 1.8 billion) from other compa- nies, including manufacturing materials with a value of around EUR 1.2 billion. In the business year 2020, Miele used a total of 127,238 tonnes of raw mate- rials (2019: 122,510 tonnes). The majority of these were metals (85 percent) in the form of iron and non-ferrous metals, steel and steel alloys. Apart from metals, Miele\\u2019s other main raw material is plastic granulate (15 percent). The company also uses auxil- iary and operating materials such as paints and oils, as well as electronic components. USE OF RECYCLABLE AND REUSABLE MATERIAL Miele appliances already contain a high pro- portion of recyclable materials and secondary raw materials \\u2013 i.e. raw materials which have already undergone a recycling process. The aim is to make even more efficient use of resources and ensure that as many mate- rials as possible are reused, which is why Miele checks that all of its materials are suit- able for use in a > closed recycling loop. This is an area that can give rise to con- flicting objectives. Using composite materials, for example, can save on resources, but can also lead to problems further down the line when materials have to be separated for recycling. Furthermore, not every mate- rial that can be easily recycled satisfies Miele\\u2019s RAW MATERIALS USED in tonnes 2020 18,641 TOTAL 127,238 108,597 Metals Plastic granulate requirements in relation to quality, durability and performance. Miele carefully weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of each material in order to maximise resource effi- ciency without compromising on quality. CORRECTLY USING RECYCLED PLASTICS [GRI 301-2] Plastics are an important com- ponent in many domestic appliances, 50  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility including vacuum cleaner casings, deter- gent drawers or the panels of washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers. Miele is always on the lookout for solu- tions involving > recycled materials so as to reduce the consumption of primary raw materials in this area too. Integrating recy- cled plastics into product development and production is a time-consuming and com- plex process. For example, the plastic has to suit the design of the respective appli- ance and pass durability tests. It is therefore very difficult to implement such a pro- cess into a pre-existing appliance series. In the long term, the aim is to expand the use of recycled materials wher- ever product characteristics allow for it and without undermining quality. In 2019, Miele committed to increasing the volume of plastic recyclates it uses to up to 7,500 tonnes by 2025. This figure cur- rently stands at roughly 194 tonnes. One of the areas where Miele already uses plastic recyclates is in its vacuum cleaner cable rewind systems. Additional pro- duction processes will be adjusted in the next few years. Recyclates are to be used in components or accessories for other product groups in addition to vacuum cleaner accessories in the near future. Pilot projects are currently under way. Each specific application has the poten- tial for the use of hundreds of kilograms of recyclate \\u2013 or even several tonnes. In 2020, Miele stepped up its efforts to coor- dinate with recyclate manufacturers and looked into material quality and durability. HIGH PROPORTION OF RECYCLED METAL [GRI 301-2] Stainless steel is a hugely impor- tant resource to Miele and can be recycled to a large extent, which is why Miele explicitly wel- comes efforts from its suppliers to process the highest possible proportion of recycled stainless steel while maintaining consistent quality. However, this proportion is set by the supplier and can vary for economic and tech- nological reasons for which Miele cannot be held responsible. As an example, it may be the case that recycled metals are no longer offered on the market at the required quality. PACKAGING: TESTING ALTERNATIVES, REDUCING WEIGHT The packaging of Miele domestic appli- ances must be robust enough to withstand the weight of the products. Stable mate- rials such as solid wood, cardboard, plastic moulded parts made from expanded polysty- rene (EPS) and polyethylene films are used in packaging, minimising damage during trans- port, storage and handling. A project team is tasked with continuously reviewing alter- native packaging materials so that Miele can switch to more environmentally friendly solu- tions in the long term. The most important criteria in this regard are high packaging stand- ards (product safety and low weight) and the smallest possible environmental footprint. In the business year 2020, the propor- tion of packaging weight in relation to all appliances produced by Miele was 9 percent (2019: 9.2 percent). 203,678 t of appliances produced in 2020 SAFE CLEANING AND CARE PRODUCTS Miele is the only household appliance man- ufacturer to offer a broad range of care and cleaning products which are perfectly aligned with machines and programme cycles. These products ensure top-class results and help customers use the right amounts to suit the degree of soiling. The demands on product packaging are high, for example with respect to durability, temperature resistance, protec- tion against light and product safety. Products are sent from Germany to all four corners of the world and need to withstand not only the transport itself, but also the changing cli- mates they are exposed to, which is why they are almost always packaged in polypropylene. This plastic meets these requirements perfectly and also has solid environmental characteris- tics, as it can be fully recycled. In addition, the cleaning products are extremely concentrated to reduce the amount of packaging required. The lids on Miele Caps laundry care capsules have been made from recycled plastic since this year. Miele Caps are small capsules pro- viding accurate and economical dosing of special detergent. This example of recy- cled packaging is set to be the first of many. ENSURING SUPPLY SECURITY Resources, materials and components must be available at the right time, in plen- tiful supply and at top standards of quality in order for Miele to use them in a suit- able manner. Miele has integrated early warning indicators for supply security into its > supplier management system to ensure that this is the case. The indi- cators have been used since 2016 for around 1,500 suppliers, who together account for more than 80 percent of the total purchasing volume. These indicators make it possible for Miele to identify potential risks which might jeopardise supply security at an early stage. Miele uses a software solution to record various hazards such as forces of nature (for example earthquakes, floods) or political risks. This process takes into account both country-specific and geo- graphical risks, as well as supplier-related risks such as creditworthiness. Pre- ventative measures, such as putting raw materials into storage at the supplier\\u2019s premises, are taken as soon as a pos- sible gap in supplies becomes apparent. As resources become ever scarcer, the increasing use of > recycled materials is also helping to ensure the supply of nec- essary raw materials in the long term. 51  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Supplier management Fair partnership with high standards Miele demands a lot from its suppliers in terms of quality and performance, but it also expects them to comply with high social and eco- logical standards. At the same time, Miele also understands that these requirements must be economically viable for suppliers. The aim is to establish long-term business relationships shaped by fairness, trust and collaboration, something that often begins in the area of > product development. Miele is constantly optimising its supplier man- agement system and adapting it to changing conditions. By doing so, Miele ensures con- sistently high product quality and long-term > supply security, as well as compliance with the latest sustainability requirements. The new German Supply Chain Act will require certain companies to ensure that human rights are respected in their supply chains from 2023. Under current legislation, the following aspects are considered relevant risk areas: forced labour, child labour, discrimination, prohibi- tion of freedom of association and problematic employment and working conditions. Miele has drawn on independent bodies to analyse these risk areas at its suppliers since 2004 and within the scope of official > SA8000 certification since 2008. Suppliers are also contractually obliged to comply with the same duties of care. PROCUREMENT CONCEPT WITH A LOCAL FOCUS [GRI 204-1] Miele products are mainly produced in Germany and other Euro- pean countries; 84 percent of deliveries to Miele plants \\u2013 based on purchasing volume \\u2013 come from Europe. This, cou- pled with > optimised transport logistics and the bundling of goods flows, saves on transport costs and reduces trans- port-related CO2 emissions. Local procurement is particularly impor- tant to the plants in China and the Czech Republic due to their distance from the other manufacturing locations. Since opening, the new plant in Poland has also looked to pro- cure materials, including washing machine doors and lids and packaging, from the local region in order to minimise transportation. The Uni\\u010dov plant in the Czech Republic also procures its packaging materials locally. SUPPLY SECURITY DURING A CRISIS The Covid-19 pandemic had a signifi- cant impact on the supply situation within the supply chain in 2020. In China, supply chains returned to normality relatively quickly. Italy, where Miele procures compo- 84% of deliveries to Miele plants \\u2013 based on purchasing volume \\u2013 come from Europe. nents from over 150 suppliers, proved to be the greatest challenge. In spite of the crisis, Miele was able to successfully avert supply risks and run its fleet of lorries at max- imum capacity. However, issues continue to plague the entire industry when it comes to procuring certain goods, including elec- tronic components and steel from India. Miele does not expect the situation to nor- malise again until 2022 at the earliest. Miele continues to expand its supply chain with the aim of implementing a dual- sourcing strategy that will allow it to avoid any future supply bottlenecks in sim- ilar situations. Dual sourcing involves procuring goods from two independent suppliers to ensure supply security even if one supplier is > unable to deliver. SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT: CHECKING SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA [GRI 308-2, 412-1, 414-2] Miele man- ages the selection of new suppliers and monitors existing suppliers with the aid of a comprehensive supplier manage- ment system. The system not only focuses on aspects such as supply availability, quality and price, it also checks compli- ance with Miele\\u2019s sustainability criteria. 52  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Compliance with > environmental, > social and economic sustainability criteria is monitored and verified several times over the course of a business relationship.

Registration Supplier self-assessment with query regarding sustainability criteria Update requested once a year SUSTAINABLE SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT Miele\\u2019s supplier management system is made up of six systematically intercon- nected elements (see diagram). It is based on material sustainability criteria and is adjusted to changing circumstances on an ongoing basis.

All suppliers, irrespec- tive of location, are required to submit a self-declaration regarding compliance with standardised sustainability requirements The self-declaration covers a number of areas, including certification, standards and additional employee-related issues, as well as compliance, prevention of cor- ruption, environmental management and climate action. The material group man- agers in Purchasing check whether the self-declarations are complete and plau- sible. In the event of non-compliance, the potential supplier is given the opportunity to implement the necessary corrective meas- ures within a reasonable amount of time and restore compliance with requirements. If this does not happen, Miele will not con- sider entering into a business relationship. 157 trained process auditors Before taking on a new manufacturing mate- rial supplier, a brief audit is carried out on site to assess compliance with process quality and sustainability standards. If Miele identifies non-conformities but feels that the supplier would otherwise be a useful partner, it works together with the supplier to find a solution. If there is no improvement, Miele blocks the applicant. Brief audits were performed online for the first time in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

These audits take place before production starts and while it is ongoing. Sustainability criteria are also mon- itored as part of these process audits. As at 31 December 2020, Miele had over 157 trained and active process auditors who con- ducted 90 internal and external audits in 2020. COMPLIANCE WITH SA8000 CRITERIA [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1] Miele places par- ticular emphasis on social standards. All of Miele\\u2019s suppliers worldwide must commit to complying with the following criteria within their own organisation in accordance with SA8000, an internationally recognised social standard, and must also monitor compli- ance on the part of their own suppliers: Ban on child labour Ban on forced or compulsory labour Health and safety in the workplace The right to freedom of associa- tion and collective bargaining Ban on discrimination Ban on disciplinary measures (in the standards on working hours Adherence to payment legislation Staff in the Purchasing department carry out a general risk classification for all sup- pliers on the basis of the SA8000 criteria. Suppliers are classified as low, medium or high risk depending on the country and the industry. There are only a small number of high-risk suppliers. Miele monitors these suppliers continuously and ensures that staff from the Purchasing department con- duct annual assessments, including by means of SA8000 audits. Any suspicions that standards have been violated trigger a multi-stage > escalation process. Miele revised its risk classification system in the reporting period and for the first time added a country risk component, which has been developed by the amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). This country classification covers the above cri- teria of the SA8000 social standard in accordance with the BSCI code. Clas- sifying country risk is aimed at helping companies to better identify potential social risks in connection with their pro- curement markets. This external instrument based on an independent database is a practical addition to Miele\\u2019s risk classifica- tion system. Any discrepancies between Miele\\u2019s risk classification and the country risk classification of amfori BSCI must be sense of physical punishment, mental 54  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility justified, explained and reviewed within the scope of an external SA8000 audit. In addition to the criteria based on SA8000, Miele requires its suppliers to provide information about which forms of employee participation the company has implemented and whether it has taken measures to ensure occupational health and safety and provide employees with additional training and support. ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL STANDARDS [GRI 308-1] As part of its efforts to main- tain ecological standards, Miele checks whether suppliers have implemented an environmental management system in line with standards such as ISO 14001, for example. The central supplier assessment system also includes information on whether the supplier uses resources in a sustain- able manner. Environmental requirements for materials and components are continu- ally adjusted to comply with the applicable legislation (such as the German Hazardous Materials Ordinance) and Miele\\u2019s internal regulations. To this end, Miele has its own company standard, which limits the use of certain substances in materials and compo- nents. Suppliers of manufacturing materials are only awarded contracts if they can con- firm compliance with this company standard. CORRUPTION PREVENTION AND COMPLIANCE Miele includes corruption prevention and com- pliance as part of its economic sustainability criteria. The criteria are based on the principles of the Global Compact of the United Nations (UN) and other > international guidelines. Staff in the Purchasing department must adhere to the > ethical guidelines for purchasing. Fair, transparent and partnership-based cooper- ation with suppliers is always paramount. The suppliers must state whether their com- pany participates in international or industry- related > compliance initiatives and whether they take measures to prevent corrup- tion \\u2013 for example, by providing an ombuds person for employees or considering the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) when selecting their upstream suppliers. Miele itself gives suppliers the opportunity to contact a specially appointed > ombudsperson. The ombudsperson acts as an independent contact person to employees, business partners and third parties should any suspicions of corruption or theft arise. Contact details for the ombudsperson are included in every Miele order. ESCALATION PROCESS IN THE CASE OF SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1] Suspicions or evi- dence that a supplier is violating SA8000 criteria or environmental standards trig- gers a multi-stage escalation process, which can culminate in the supplier being struck off the approved list and blocked for the future. Serious violations will generally lead to abso- lute and immediate termination of the contract. If investigations into a supplier reveal abnor- malities, the supplier may still be able to continue working with Miele depending on its subsequent development and improve- ment. However, the supplier in question must draw up an action plan in collaboration with Miele\\u2019s Purchasing and Quality Management departments and rectify the non-conform- ities in full within the specified period. Abnormalities were determined in relation to one supplier during the reporting period. The supplier in question was inspected according to the escalation plan and suc- cessfully implemented the measures agreed with Miele to rectify the issues. No sup- pliers were blocked in the reporting period.

The company is working to continuously reduce the envi- ronmental impact caused at its sites by waste water, waste and emissions, as well as energy-intensive processes and logis- tics. It manufactures all of its products in a resource-friendly manner, using as little energy as possible. Miele takes great pre- cautions here, ensuring that environmental protection is considered at an early stage when planning systems and processes. CERTIFIED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Miele uses an > integrated management system to manage operational environ- mental protection throughout the company. The environmental management system, which is certified according to ISO 14001 at all Miele production locations world- wide, is an important component of the integrated management system. It contains guidelines on how to deal with materials, water, waste and emissions. Miele also manages and monitors its environmental performance with the help of environmental performance indicators. The management system is reviewed at the beginning of each business year, with progress being meas- ured on the basis of the results of individual reviews conducted at the various Miele plants. These results are then used to set new objectives. The internal reviews are sup- plemented by external monitoring audits. Miele\\u2019s ISO 50001-certified > energy management system at all European pro- duction sites is another component of the integrated management system. This system helps the sites identify poten- tial for further energy savings and introduce corresponding measures. European sites are recertified in accor- dance with ISO 50001 every three years. The energy management system at Euro- pean sites was recertified at the end of 2020. The new washing machine plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, Poland, commenced operations in Sep- tember 2019 and achieved ISO 50001 certification in May 2021. The energy man- agement system at the Dongguan location in China is also based on ISO 50001. Management staff from different produc- tion sites regularly liaise on best practices. Miele reviews its energy management system annually by means of internal audits carried 918,000 \\u20ac was invested by Miele in environmental protection measures at its manufacturing sites in 2020. out by five specially trained employees. The audits performed in the business years 2019 and 2020 did not find any non-conformi- ties and only made recommendations for optimising individual process descriptions. Management has already begun imple- menting the improvements, which included coordinating the process of defining key performance indicators, as well as re - designing and simplifying energy reports. These audits ensure that Miele fulfils the national implementation of the 2015 Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), which requires companies to carry out an energy audit every four years. DIN EN 16247-1 energy audits are also performed at relevant sales subsidiaries. Energy management meetings took place online in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the number of meetings increased to four, with shorter intervals between meetings and more up-to-date discussions, which proved to be particularly advantageous with regard to the implementation of the ambitious new > sustainability strategy. In future, Miele plans to hold both online and in-person meetings depending on the subject matter. 56  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility plants and from Dongguan in China also reg- ularly attend the workshops in Germany.

Each area has its own responsible officers at the Miele head- quarters and at the individual plants. All of the plant officers report to the headquar- ters in G\\u00fctersloh. Information is shared between plants on a continuous basis, with operational environmental protection and energy management teams usually meeting twice a year at one of the German sites. These meetings are used to discuss individual efficiency projects, to provide information about changes in the legal framework and for further training. Representatives from other European [GRI 307-1] Miele operates a standardised legal management system for operational envi- ronmental protection, energy management and occupational health and safety at all of its German plants. This system monitors compli- ance with standards and legal requirements and continued to prove its worth during the reporting period. It guarantees consistent and simple compliance monitoring and makes it possible to additionally incorporate legal require- ments from official authorisations. Realising operational environmental protection remains the responsibility of each individual site. There were no recorded infringements of environ- mental regulations in the reporting period. PROFESSIONAL COMPLAINTS MANAGEMENT [GRI 413-1/-2] Employees, residents, busi- ness partners or other persons can report suspected violations of environmental pro- tection rules at any time and can get in touch with Miele by telephone, e-mail or letter. The headquarters or the plants are the main contacts for this purpose. The respon- sible department or the plant management will examine the situation and clarify or elim- inate the causes. In the event of a serious complaint, the company management will be involved at an early stage. No significant complaints concerning environmental emis- sions were received in the reporting period. MIELE SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE LIVING IN THE CITY What will sustainable and energy-efficient living look like in the future? One possible answer is provided by a pilot > project in Melbourne: a self-sufficient house built by eco-innovator Joost Bakker in 2020 \\u2013 sponsored by the Australian sales company. The zero-waste house has closed cycles, supplies the res- idents with renewable energy and is geared towards urban fruit and vegetable cultivation. In addition to domestic appliances for the laundry room, Miele also provided a complete kitchen, including a wine con- ditioning unit. All appliances used in the house are solar powered. After delays due to the pandemic, the house was ready for moving in at the end of 2020.

However, its efforts also include avoiding waste and minimising water consumption, not only protecting the environment in the process, but also helping to ensure supply security and cut costs too. Miele continu- ously optimises its production processes for this purpose, reusing materials where pos- sible and recycling where not. Preferentially, materials are reused immediately or recycled. WASTE AVOIDANCE AND EXTENSIVE USE OF RECYCLING [GRI 306-1/-2] Waste can never be completely avoided in manufacturing. At Miele, waste is carefully separated into reusable containers on site as soon as it is produced. Miele uses specialist companies to dispose of waste. In the business year 2020, Miele plants pro- duced a total of 37,413 tonnes of waste, around 9.4 percent more than in 2019 (34,190 tonnes). This increase was due to a rise in production activity, as well as a greater volume of chrome steel waste from the commissioning of a new welding system in G\\u00fctersloh. The resulting scrap was recycled. However, the new system has also increased the level of vertical integra- tion at the G\\u00fctersloh site, as the parts (cast flanges) can now be produced in-house rather than being purchased. Another reason for the increase in waste was the soil extracted for a new supply duct at the Lehrte site. TOTAL WASTE PRODUCED in tonnes 2020 2019 37,413 34,190 DESTINATION OF TOTAL WASTE1) in tonnes 1,781 309 2,271 2020 Materials recycling, processing Energy recovery, incineration Physicochemical treatment Dumping 33,053 Miele reviews these companies in > waste disposal audits and works with other manufacturers within the scope of these audits. Besides the legal requirements defined in the German Waste Management Act (KrWG), the audits also look at additional aspects such as whether waste is checked, whether approvals have been provided for waste disposal facilities, what condition the laboratories are in and whether the scales have been calibrated properly. Waste disposal companies are responsible for recording waste output from Miele plants. When it comes to transporting hazardous waste, Miele only employs the services of specialist companies both in Ger- many and at its sites outside of Germany. Miele itself does not export any waste. A total of 95 percent of the waste produced at Miele\\u2019s plants worldwide was recycled in the business years 2019 and 2020. The volume of hazardous waste recycled and disposed of in the reporting period fell by a small margin of 4.2 percent from 2,687 tonnes to 2,574 tonnes in the reporting period. Numerous waste treatment facilities are cur- rently in the process of setting new acceptance criteria for recycling processes. In the past, sludge from Miele\\u2019s waste water processing facilities and foundry was recycled for use as a construction additive. This construction additive is used at landfill sites to secure waste and build access routes. With the number of landfill sites decreasing in Germany, this form of recycling will no longer be available in the future, which is why processing landfill waste will be classified as a waste disposal process rather than a recycling process moving forward. This would result in the share of Miele waste that is recycled falling markedly. RAISING AWARENESS AMONG EMPLOYEES [GRI 306-1/-2] All Miele employees need to pull their weight to ensure that waste is avoided as much as possible and disposed of prop- erly when it is produced. Miele has various measures to raise employee awareness of this topic, including noticeboards on how to properly separate waste at production sites. 1) See page 97 for further explanation. 58  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Miele\\u2019s sales subsidiary in Canada has introduced a system of waste separation and organised an employee competition to reduce waste. The Russian sales subsidiary has been working on measures to raise employee awareness of the environment in their day- to-day work since 2017 as part of the ECO Office project. In 2020, the office replaced single-use cutlery and plates, which were commonplace, with ceramic tableware and metal cutlery and installed a water dispenser. The same measures were intro- duced at the sales subsidiary in Italy. Both sales subsidiaries saw a marked decline in the use of plastic single-use bottles. The Australian sales subsidiary con- ducted an online survey on employees\\u2019 printing habits, which focused on ways of reducing the number of printed documents and general paper consumption. Around 250 employees took part in the survey in 2020, providing a great many ideas and sug- gestions. The company is currently working on a detailed proposal for implementation. SYSTEMATIC WATER MANAGEMENT [GRI 303-1] Miele is reliant on water throughout its value chain. Plants require cooling water to manufacture Miele appli- ances, and water is also needed to operate kitchens and bathroom facilities and for watering green spaces. The produc- tion plants in G\\u00fctersloh and Bra\\u0219ov cover most of their water requirements from their own well facilities, while other plants draw water from municipal systems. Miele strives to consistently reduce its water consumption through systematic water man- agement. All water-saving measures are, of course, implemented without affecting drinking water hygiene. As an example, Miele has spent the past few years sepa- rating its drinking water and firefighting water facilities at its G\\u00fctersloh site, which had pre- viously been operated as a single system. Miele installed smaller pipes for the drinking water system, allowing water consump- tion to be reduced. The old drinking water pipes were oversized for current drinking water requirements and had to be flushed out very often to prevent bacteria from building up. The large-diameter pipe network had been originally installed to provide effective and rapid access to large volumes of water to fight fires. However, a new 1,250 cubic metre water tank has since been installed to provide water for firefighting from 2021. Water abstraction per tonne of product climbed from 1.85 cubic metres in 2019 to 1.93 cubic metres in the business year 2020. In absolute terms, water abstraction increased from 358,789 cubic metres to 393,827 cubic metres year on year in the business year 2020 due to the repeated exchange of water in the cooling tower for hygiene reasons and the increased use of rinsing water during the commissioning of a cooling system in G\\u00fcter- sloh, among other factors. In addition, the new plant in Poland was included in the data for the first time in 2020. Another reason for the increased water consumption is the dry summer in 2020 and the need to water green spaces as a result. Drip irrigation sys- tems have been installed at some sites to reduce water consumption in the future. Plants outside of Germany have also imple- mented a water management system, including measures to reduce water con- sumption. In Dongguan, China, for instance, water meters have been installed to analyse water usage and set consumption targets. WASTE WATER: REGULAR MEASUREMENTS [GRI 303-1/-2, 306-3] The plants in G\\u00fcter- sloh, Oelde, Lehrte and B\\u00fcrmoos are able to discharge their waste water into the public sewer system due to its high quality. These indirect discharges are subject to the waste water regulations of the respective munic- ipalities. Waste water is treated before it is discharged, with heavy metals being pre- cipitated using lime milk in G\\u00fctersloh and Oelde to filter these substances out of the waste water. Precipitation is a chemical pro- cess for isolating a dissolved substance from a solution. The heavy metals are then deposited as particles and filtered out by the filters. In addition, the waste water is also neutralised. This all ensures that Miele complies with the limits stipulated by munic- ipal waste water regulations. Miele regularly conducts internal analysis and submits random samples to the authorities for anal- ysis to monitor the quality of this process. As at all other Miele plants, regular sam- ples are taken to ensure that the water WASTE WATER in cubic metres 2020 362,702 2019 313,264 quality is perfect. In the reporting period, there were no notable or significant cases of municipal limits being exceeded. At the Bra\\u015fov plant, domestic waste water is treated in the plant\\u2019s own biological treat- ment plant and before being discharged into the B\\u00e2rsa stream. But that is set to change from the end of 2021, when Miele waste water will be discharged through a new sewer system to a new public treatment plant, where it will be treated. So far, there are no manufacturing processes at the new Ksaw- er\\u00f3w plant that produce technical waste water. Other waste water produced by this plant is discharged into a municipal treat- ment plant through the public sewer system. On account of the increase in water con- sumption in the business year 2020, the waste water of all Miele plants climbed to 362,702 cubic metres in the business year 2020 (2019: 313,264 cubic metres). 59  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Energy and emissions Focus on climate action Climate change is one of the greatest chal- lenges we face, and climate action is one of Miele\\u2019s key sustainability tasks. That is why Miele has refined its climate action strategy during the reporting period, defining ambi- tious new goals. The climate action strategy centres on avoiding and reducing CO2 emissions and compensating where such measures are not (yet) possible. The pri- mary instruments in Miele\\u2019s strategy are investment in efficiency measures, the expansion of in-house energy generation and the targeted reduction of emissions in the upstream and downstream value chain. CO2 NEUTRALITY FOR ALL SITES FROM 2021 As part of its climate strategy, Miele has decided to shift to carbon-neutral production from 2021, as relates to the company\\u2019s own emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions attrib- utable to energy suppliers (Scope 2). At the same time, the company aims to cut the CO2 emissions of its global production and sales sites, including the vehicle fleet, by 50 per- cent in absolute terms by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. To do so, Miele will be investing primarily in energy efficiency and gener- ating its own renewable energy at its sites. ELEMENTS OF THE MIELE CLIMATE STRATEGY Energy-efficient products Appropriate management mechanisms (internal CO2 price) Energy-efficient production The strategy was adopted by the Exec- utive Board in October 2020. A number of measures were then resolved and initial steps taken toward implemen- tation. The new climate strategy is an integral part of the enhanced > sustainability strategy, through which Miele notably refined its objectives in key focus areas in the reporting period. Compensation of unavoidable emissions ELEMENTS OF THE MIELE CLIMATE STRATEGY Sustainable materials By developing and adopting its new climate strategy, Miele meets the require- ments of the > Science Based Targets initiative, which aims to bring corporate climate targets in line with the latest climate findings.

But they can also improve the day-to-day lives of people, too. Since 2021, Miele has been involved in a project to equip rural households in Nepal with small biogas plants as part of the com- pany\\u2019s CO2 compensation project. Instead of using firewood to cook, and producing harmful smoke, fam- ilies use biogas. In addition, residual materials from the plants can be used as fertiliser, increasing agri- cultural yields. People are no longer reliant solely on wood, meaning that deforestation has also declined, helping to preserve species diversity and coun- teract soil erosion. A total of 350 biogas plants have been constructed with Miele\\u2019s assistance. PRODUCTS & SERVICES Supplier management SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility GENERATING OWN ENERGY AND PROCURING GREEN ELECTRICITY Miele commissioned a photovoltaic plant in Dongguan, China, in April 2021. Other projects are in the pipeline, both at Miele produc- tion sites and at sales companies. In addition, Miele is in the process of switching its energy supply to fully renewable sources, with all global sites set to procure green electricity by the end of 2021. The plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, which was opened at the start of 2019, has been using green electricity since produc- tion operations commenced. All production sites in Germany, as well as those in B\\u00fcrmoos, Bra\\u015fov and Uni\\u010dov, have been operating on renewable electricity since 2020. Many inter- national sales companies, such as those in the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as the Steelco Group, also operate on green electricity exclusively. projects in the United States to plant new hardwood forests in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which is one of North America\\u2019s most important deciduous forest ecosystems. PROMOTING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES Miele also supports innovative tech- nological approaches to reducing or sequestering carbon. One project in Austria and Germany supports the storage of carbon for agricultural use. In this project, vegetable carbon is being used for long-term carbon storage, and is applied to the soil, improving soil fer- tility and increasing humus levels in the process. Miele co-finances the project. REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF PRODUCTS COMPENSATION OF UNAVOIDABLE EMISSIONS Miele compensates for unavoidable emis- sions by purchasing high-quality CO2 certificates and investing in global climate action projects, including a solar-thermal project in India and a biogas project in Nepal. In Nicaragua, Miele supports an initiative for sustainable coffee growing. The tech- nical and financial support provided by Miele helps Nicaraguan farmers manage their plan- tations in a more environmentally friendly way. Other initiatives include reforesta- tion projects in Uganda, a country that has lost more than 40 percent of its forests in the past 20 years. Miele also supports The majority of the CO2 emissions that make up Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint are produced during the use of products (Scope 3.11) and during the purchasing of goods and services (Scope 3.1), both of which are areas where a further reduc- tion of CO2 emissions is necessary. Initial pilot projects are currently under way. THE JOURNEY TO THE CLIMATE STRATEGY Allocating emissions to certain activities is a key part of effective climate action. The annual > carbon footprint report acts as a basis for Miele\\u2019s current climate strategy process. 61  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility In 2020, at the beginning of the strategy process, Miele extended the coverage of its carbon footprint report to interna- tional sales subsidiaries, the Steelco Group and its shareholding in Korean robotics specialist Yujin. Miele also carried out poten- tial analysis, which was used to pinpoint energy- efficiency measures, evaluate the potential of own energy generation and green electricity procurement and quan- tify significant Scope 3 emissions. The next step was to simulate and model potential measures to cut Scope 1, 2 and 3 emis- sions and the resulting costs. At this stage, Miele also looked into potential strategies to achieve carbon neutrality through ener- gy-efficiency measures, ways to increase own energy generation, opportunities to increase the amount of green electricity and possibilities for carbon compensation. SYSTEMATIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT The energy industry in Germany and Europe is undergoing a structural shift towards solar and wind energy. However, both of these renewable sources are weather-de- pendent and therefore volatile. Energy bottlenecks must be avoided, and avail- ability and stable prices secured. Hence why it is important for Miele to adapt to the changes by implementing new energy storage concepts and efficient internal man- agement mechanisms. Miele firmly believes that the only way to absorb the differences between volatile supply and uniform demand is to store energy in the form of hydrogen, which is why the company is investing in the development of hydrogen-based energy storage solutions. Dr Reinhard Zinkann is a co-signatory to the white paper \\u201cAufbruch in die Zukunft: Transfor- mationspfade f\\u00fcr nachhaltige industrielle Projekte in Nordrhein-Westfalen\\u201d (Journey into the future: transformation path- ways for sustainable industrial projects in North Rhine-Westphalia), which con- tains 13 specific project proposals for the further development of hydrogen tech- nology. The paper is the result of top-level meetings initiated by the state gov- ernment of North Rhine-Westphalia. Energy storage is an important piece of the puzzle, but efficient energy flows are also crucial. Thanks to the ISO 50001 energy management standard, which has been applied since its introduction in 2011, Miele has been able to transparently doc- ument energy flows at its sites and, in doing so, uncover potential for improve- ments in efficiency. Within this framework, the company has also set up a number of > performance indicators to mon- itor achievement of efficiency targets and plan infrastructure measures. The foundry and enamelling processes are particu- larly energy-intensive parts of production. ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE Energy efficiency has always been a top priority at Miele, and not just with the company\\u2019s products. In the early 1980s, Miele began designing new build- ings with more efficient low-temperature systems and facilities. Nowadays, this tech- nology is being used on an increasing basis in modern heating networks. Miele has its own electricity grids at its plants and sites. Featuring 40 transformers, the grid at the G\\u00fctersloh site is comparable to that of a small town. Miele also feeds electricity into its internal grids with its cogeneration plants in B\\u00fcnde and Bielefeld, and the pho- tovoltaic system in G\\u00fctersloh. This kind of infrastructure has been a resounding suc- cess so far, which is why Miele believes that small electricity grids with decentral- ised energy generation and storage can play a major role in the energy transition. In G\\u00fctersloh, Miele is also a partner in the city\\u2019s heat distribution network, with waste heat from a high-efficiency gas-fired power station used to heat the entire G\\u00fctersloh site since 2008 \\u2013 and improving the energy yield of the power station turbines in the pro- cess. Miele continues to hold small boiler systems on standby as a contingency for its production activities. The family-owned company is in constant dialogue with dis- trict heating provider Fernw\\u00e4rmegesellschaft G\\u00fctersloh to increase the efficiency of the network and reveal untapped potential. ENERGY EFFICIENCY COMPETENCY NETWORK Maintaining and facilitating dialogue is an area of extreme importance to Miele, which is why the company has its own com- petency network on the issue of energy efficiency.

The network\\u2019s experts form various working groups to look into issues or technologies such as com- pressed air or refrigeration systems. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the network met up as often as three times a year. In 2020, the meetings were organised online, and members of the network quickly realised that online meetings can also have added bene- fits: Teams met more frequently, the issues they discussed were more relevant and out- comes were more effective. Competency network meetings in the reporting period focused on improving and enhancing the sys- tems used to measure energy consumption.

Total energy consumption is made up of direct energy consumption (heating oil, natural gas) and indirect consumption (district heating and electrical energy); see diagram below. The > Key figures section includes a detailed breakdown and explanations. Specific energy consumption per produced appli- ance was reduced further in the reporting period. In the business year 2020, the lion\\u2019s share of energy requirements (86 per- cent) were covered by green electricity. In 2021, all sites use green electricity.

Employees can also com- plete an e-learning module on the subject, or find a broad range of information on how to save energy in their day-to-day work on the company intranet. The information is pre- pared for different target groups, such as office personnel and employees working in plant engineering, and is continuously updated. Tips include how to save energy through correct ventilation and heating. CURRENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION [GRI 305-1/-2/-3/-5] Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint is calculated on the basis of the international Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. It is prepared using a market-based approach, which applies the specific emission factors of energy suppliers. Emissions consist of direct emissions from oil and gas consumption as well as Miele\\u2019s fleet of vehicles (Scope 1), indirect emissions from electricity and dis- trict heating (Scope 2) and indirect Scope 3 emissions. Besides purchased goods and services and the use of sold products, Scope 3 emissions now also include capital goods, fuel- and energy-related emis- sions, transportation and distribution, waste, business travel, commuting, rented facil- ities and how sold products are handled at the end of their lifecycle.

Direct emissions (Scope 1) were cut by 8 percent in the same period. This is due to the reduced consumption of natural gas and heating oil and the pandemic-based decline in fleet mileage. Miele reduced indirect emissions (Scope 2) by a much larger margin of 65 percent on account of most of Miele\\u2019s sites covering their energy requirements with green electricity (86 percent). Moreover, electricity and district heat consumption fell further year on year. remaining 30 percent are currently in the process of being converted to use R290-grade fluid. Appliances produced for commercial applications. will only be filled with R600a refrigerant from 2021. Motor production at the Euskirchen site produces volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs), but these pollutants are eliminated by a post-combustion process, bringing the total amount in exhaust air below legal limits. HOW TO DEAL WITH ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GASES AND OTHER EMISSIONS [GRI 305-7] In addition to CO 2 emis- sions, Miele also strives to reduce other greenhouse gases and harmful emissions. Refrigerants containing chlorofluorocar- bons (CFCs) are still occasionally used at Miele plants: for example for air-con- ditioning technology, compressed air dryers and small-scale systems such as climate-controlled chests. These refrig- erants are gradually being replaced by more climate-friendly alternatives. Miele products also contain refrigerants, but since 2020 only R600a-grade fluid has been used worldwide. In 2020, 70 per- cent of heat pump tumble dryers were also produced using the environmentally friendly refrigerant R290 (propane).

The task of the logistics depart- ment is to make sure that Miele is able to supply its products on time to sales sub- sidiaries and customers all over the world. Miele has set itself the objective of mini- mising the impact of this level of traffic on the environment and the climate as much as possible, as well as optimising the nec- essary shipments. This is achieved using state-of-the-art logistics processes from the central Miele logistics centre in G\\u00fctersloh. Most delivery routes are relatively short: eight out of twelve of the Miele production sites are located in Germany, with the fur- thest situated 215 kilometres away from G\\u00fctersloh. Europe continues to be the key market for Miele products, as over 80 per- cent of sales are generated there \\u2013 and one third in Germany alone. The neces- sary shipments and deliveries are managed efficiently. In addition, Miele aims to uti- lise modes of transport that generate the lowest possible level of emissions. Carbon emissions are a significant selection crite- rion for Miele when it comes to awarding contracts to transport service providers. The company avoids the use of air freight as far as possible and carefully reviews any instances of transportation by air. SHIPPING THE MOST IMPORTANT MODE OF TRANSPORT Transport volumes rose by 12 percent in the business year 2020 to 1,008 million tonne-kilometres (compared to the busi- ness year 2019). This includes transport on own account and deliveries to Miele sales subsidiaries (outbound). The increase is mainly due to the positive sales develop- ment at sales subsidiaries overseas, as well as in Southern and Eastern Europe. Miele successfully maintained the propor- tion of its outbound shipments transported by ship and rail at an extremely high level of over 85 percent. Once again, an extremely low percentage of shipments were made by air (0.8 percent). Of Miele\\u2019s transport on own account, 43 percent was com- pleted by ship and 57 percent by lorry. CALCULATING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND OTHER EMISSIONS [GRI 305-3] Miele uses software to determine the environmental impact of its transport logistics that calculates the transport volume and greenhouse gas emissions based on the OUTBOUND TRANSPORT VOLUME in shares (related to tonne-kilometres) 2 1 14 2020 83 by ship by rail by lorry by air EN 16258 CEN standard. In the business year 2020, transport-related emissions increased by 3 percent, from 60,235 tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2019 to 62,212 tonnes CO2-equivalent. These emissions include outbound logistics, global distribution and transport on own account. The rise in CO2 emissions was much less significant than the increase in transport volume. Noise also forms part of transport-related emissions. Noise emissions are legally regulated in Germany and in many other countries. Certain noise thresholds must not be exceeded, especially at night, to protect the public and the areas around the plants from harmful noise-related environmental effects. This is monitored on the basis of a noise register containing all noise sources. Miele adhered to all requirements during the reporting period. OPTIMAL USE OF TRANSPORT VEHICLE CAPACITIES A key way of reducing the environmental impact of transport is the optimal utilisa- tion of the means of transport in procurement and distribution logistics.

In Germany, it is responsible for identifying and hiring suitable applicants. The sales subsidiaries have their own HR managers and/or departments. The central HR department coordinates its activi- ties regularly with the individual departments, local HR departments, the management of the sales subsidiaries and the works council. In industrialised countries, demographic change is intensifying the competition for well-trained specialists. Global markets and increasing digital connectivity are also changing the demands employees face. Strategic human resources management constantly aims to attract a sufficient number of qualified, creative and enthusiastic minds to the company and to ensure their long-term loyalty, even under the present conditions. This is crucial in supporting Miele\\u2019s efforts to be an innovation leader in the industry on a lasting basis. The focus is on the short-, medium- and long-term need for employees in all areas of the company.

The Miele employer brand is a central element of the Human Resources strategy and helps make Miele even more appealing to highly qualified young pro- fessionals. The company is increasingly looking not only for candidates with tech- nical profiles, but IT and digitalisation professionals as well. Miele posts ads for these prospective employees, particu- larly on the internet and on social media. STRONG IDENTIFICATION WITH MIELE Since 2012, Miele has carried out employee surveys to measure how satis- fied employees are in their workplace and how strongly they identify with the com- pany. Miele focuses on different issues and metrics depending on the location. 240 anniversaries were celebrated in 2020. the company placed 41st. Some 143,000 company evaluations were considered for the study. Another magazine, stern, ranked Miele the 25th most popular employer and first in the \\u201cDurable Con- sumer Goods\\u201d category in 2019. This survey involved 45,000 employees in Germany. STAFF RETENTION: LOW TURNOVER RATES, LOTS OF ANNIVERSARIES [GRI 401-1] Miele is traditionally characterised by a high rate of staff retention. Most employees stay with Miele for many years. The staff turnover rate at the German locations stood at 1.33 percent in the business year 2020 (2019: 1.76 percent). Numerous anniversaries were celebrated in the reporting period. In the business year 2020, 240 employees worldwide celebrated 25, 40 and even 50 years with the company (2019: 319 employees with anniversaries). Local celebrations were postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. mented, helping save over 1.9 million euros. A total of 371,000 euros were paid out as bonuses in the business year 2020. The Miele idea management programme is being fully digitalised by stages. This will enable greater transparency and process speed and may make it easier to share knowledge. In 2018, Miele renamed its corporate sugges- tion scheme, dubbing it \\u201cIdee M\\u201d (\\u201cIdea M\\u201d), while also modernising various processes in an effort to respond even more flexibly to ideas when they are received. Idee M launched a campaign called \\u201c120 Jahre Immer Besser\\u201d (\\u201c120 Years, Ever Better\\u201d), inviting employees to win special prizes if their suggestions were accepted by the idea management pro- gramme. All entrants also received physical prizes and a 20 percent addition to the usual idea bonus. During the campaign, 1,521 ideas were submitted and then reviewed and evaluated by experts with an eye to implemen- tation. In 2019, 2,983 ideas were submitted, and the number for 2020 was 1,659. The sharp change was due to the reduction in on-site work brought on by the pandemic. The last surveys were conducted in 2018, eliciting feedback from employees of sales subsidiaries and the Bra\\u015fov, Dongguan and Uni\\u010dov plants. These surveys showed high levels of identification and engagement among the international workforce, well above the average of the manufacturing industry. The next worldwide survey is scheduled for 2021.

PRO-GE is the responsible trade union in Austria, with KOVO acting as our labour partner in the Czech Republic. The plant in Bra\\u015fov, Romania, is subject to a collective labour agreement that governs the funda- mental demands, as well as the organisation and structure of employment relationships. Working conditions for employees in Ger- many, Austria, the Czech Republic and Romania are therefore all regulated in collec- tive bargaining agreements, equating to a 66.8 percent share of all Miele employees (as at 31 December 2020). The employment relationship between Miele and the tempo- rary agency workers employed at Miele\\u2019s German locations is governed by the collec- tive wage agreements concluded by the agencies themselves. Works councils look after the interests of employees in Germany and at our Czech plant, as well as at some of our sales subsid- iaries, such as in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Employees at our plant in Dongguan, China, for example, have enjoyed representation since 2009. Such representation is not mandatory under local law. The employee representatives there meet with the HR department on a monthly basis to discuss suggestions and deal with potential areas of conflict. The interests of the employees at the plant in Uni\\u010dov, Czech Republic, are represented through the KOVO union and in regular meetings between internal employee representatives and plant management. At smaller sales subsidiaries, such as those in Poland or Ireland, the dialogue between employees and manage- ment is a direct and ongoing process, but has not been formally defined. SOCIAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-1/-2] Miele is respectful and responsible in its dealings with employees. This is a key feature of the Miele corporate culture, and one that has been under- scored since back in 2004 by the company\\u2019s voluntary pledge to fulfil the internationally rec- ognised SA8000 social standard. This has been officially certified since 2008. The standard includes the requirement to observe decent working conditions, to guarantee freedom of association and the prohibition of child labour and discrimination. An external service pro- vider performs a monitoring audit every six months to determine whether this standard is met. All plant locations are > SA8000 certified and undergo recertification every three years. The most recent scheduled recertification took place in 2019; the plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, Poland, is slated for recertification in 2022. It goes without saying that Miele respects human rights in all its business activities. Miele conveys this pledge to employees as part of the company philosophy right from the beginning of their employment. In the reporting period, 115 managers and employees from HR were trained with an online learning programme on the German General Act on Equal Treatment (Allge- meines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, or AGG). Since the programme was introduced, a total of 1,649 employees have completed the training. Software-based training is also held 4,126 employees have been digitally trained on the Code of Conduct. on the company\\u2019s code of conduct. So far, 4,126 have received training worldwide, 699 of them during the reporting period. Miele also requires its suppliers to comply with > social criteria. Miele purchasing employees receive regular information to raise aware- ness of this topic. Venues for providing information include the semiannual meetings of SA8000 management representatives, the quarterly meetings of the social performance teams and the company-wide SA8000 infor- mation portals. In 2019, the company began holding meetings with the central purchasing team every six weeks to optimise procure- ment processes in keeping with ethics standards. The focus here is on cross- plant coordination and on implementation of SA8000 requirements by suppliers, taking country-specific circumstances into account. Miele also provides new hires with infor- mation about complying with social and ethical standards during the two-day \\u201cWelcome@Miele\\u201d event. New Miele employees get to know the company and its culture in depth during this onboarding event. TRANSPARENT COMPLAINTS PROCESS [GRI 406-1] Every employee in Germany has the right to turn to a complaints office, which offers help as the first point of contact in the case of suspected discrim- ination. In accordance with the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), the works council is involved in handling and evalu- ating incoming complaints. Miele has set up dedicated complaints offices, each of which is staffed by one man and one 70  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement woman, at every company location in Germany. All complaints are naturally con- fidential. Similar systems are in place at the international sites. The complaints office works closely with the aggrieved person to review the circumstances surrounding the complaint. Wherever possible, the results of the review are communicated within one month. Information on how to contact the individual complaints offices is accessible to all employees on the intranet. In addi- tion, employees or business partners of Miele or other third parties can contact an ombudsperson if they believe there are indi- cations that criminal laws have been violated within the company\\u2019s sphere of influence. In the reporting period, the com- plaints offices in Germany received a total of one AGG complaint related to gender and ethnic background. In this case, remedial measures were taken and further support was offered. FAIR PAY \\u2013 NATURALLY [GRI 202-1] Miele believes in paying all employees an appropriate wage or salary based on collective and corporate agree- ments. Such pay meets or exceeds > the real-world living wage at the loca- tion in question and comes with a variety of voluntary benefits. In keeping with the founders\\u2019 philosophy, such benefits are paid regardless of the current eco- nomic climate or business performance. The company stands by its pledge to be an attractive employer, even \\u2013 and espe- cially \\u2013 in tough economic times. A LONG TRADITION OF COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS [GRI 201-3, 401-2, 404-2] Miele has offered its employees a company pension scheme since 1929. Today, Miele supports its employees in Germany in saving for retire- ment through a variety of models, such as private pension schemes or deferred com- pensation. Depending on the company agreement and collective wage agreement, employees in Germany can pay up to 4 per- cent of the contribution assessment ceiling for pension insurance (Western states) into a tax-privileged pension insurance fund. Miele grants special one-off payments and allowances for health treatments and dental prostheses that go beyond the stat- utory requirements and the provisions of the collective wage agreements, as well as payments in the event of births, marriages, deaths, milestone birthdays and work anni- versaries. In addition, employees receive benefits and individually negotiated perks such as meal subsidies and coverage of travel expenses. The company provides its former and active employees with modern health insurance coverage through its com- pany insurance provider. Some sales subsidiaries also have separate health insurance programmes for their employees. They also provide their employees with the option of discounted supplemental insurance policies, such as denture insur- ance. In some cases, employees can also take advantage of pension, health, invalidity and survivors insurance. 1929 was the year Miele introduced company retirement benefits. Both in Germany and internationally, benefits are granted regardless of whether employees have full-time, part-time, tem- porary or permanent contracts. Rules on company pensions vary internationally due to local differences and legal requirements. GOOD INTEGRATION OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES [GRI 102-8] In the business year 2020, the share of the workforce in Germany con- sisting of temporary employees stood at 5 percent, up from 3.4 percent in 2019. In a company-wide agreement signed in 2007, Miele committed to only work with recruit- ment agencies that have concluded a collective wage agreement. This regulates pay and the industry supplement, which is between 15 and 30 percent of the base pay under the collective agreement for the metal industry. In the company-wide agree- ment, Miele also agreed to increase the pay of temporary agency employees by an addi- tional 6 to 8 percent (scaled according to duration of the employment period). 71  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement AWARDS: RECOGNITION FOR HR POLICIES Miele has received several awards for its exemplary HR work.

Employees in Germany may take advan- tage of flexitime, provided there are no production-related reasons or other urgent considerations to the contrary. In the business year 2020, the percentage of employees with flexitime stood at 59 percent.

The models provide various part-time or full-time employ- ment arrangements. In the business year 2019, the proportion of employees working part-time in Germany was 8.0 percent, while in the business year 2020, this figure stood at 8.2 percent.

A healthy workforce is the foundation of long-term success for any company. Supporting and maintaining employees\\u2019 physical and mental abilities to perform is therefore the very highest priority. The basis for these efforts is a thoughtfully conceived, prevention-driven health man- agement programme, combined with safe and ergonomically designed workplaces. A CLEAR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY ORGANISATION [GRI 403-1/-4/-5/-7/-8] As an employer, Miele is responsible for its employees\\u2019 safety. To keep everyone safe, all Miele plants worldwide have obtained certification under the internationally recognised DIN EN ISO 45001 > occupational safety management system. This type of certifi- cation fully replaces the previous OHSAS 18001 framework. The company was recertified in 2020. 4% of the entire workforce is involved in Work Safety Committees. at Miele is directly involved with these commit- tees. These meetings shifted to digital in 2020. In Germany, the Works Constitution Act gov- erns how the works councils of the plants should be involved in matters of workplace health and safety. On the international front, there are corresponding regulations that govern the involvement of employees and their representa- tives. All rules on occupational safety and health also apply to non-Miele employees whose work and/or workplaces are controlled by Miele. The age structure remains a challenge for Miele. At the end of the business years 2019 and 2020, about 46 percent of employees in Germany were 50 years old or above, with the average age as at 31 December 2020 standing at 46.76 years. This means that workstations must be designed to be both age-appropriate and appropriate for ageing workers. To Miele, this means creating suitable pathways for dif- ferent age groups. During this reporting period, the company analysed whether workstations and workflows in production, particularly series production, were ergonomically designed. The results of this analysis were used to revise a number of processes. In assembly, the com- pany worked with employees to develop ideas for an overhaul. In addition, jobs that are espe- cially physically demanding received relief from driverless transport systems and automation. Miele has 24 dedicated specialists employed solely for the purpose of ensuring occupational safety at its plants (in the business year 2020). In addition, the company also has 235 safety officers who perform these tasks alongside their regular company duties. These include pro- viding advice during the planning and realisation of plant systems or when workstations are being designed. The safety officers receive regular con- tinuing education, including quarterly training on various safety topics ranging from haz- ardous substances to noise. Furthermore, regular instruction takes place at all locations. Extensive checklists are available for daily work activities. Regular safety meetings are held at all plants and all departments are frequently inspected. The inspections ensure that the necessary actions are taken conscientiously. Approximately 20 to 25 inspections per year are conducted in G\\u00fctersloh alone. There are also regular continuing educa- tion and training activities to raise all employees\\u2019 awareness of safety in the workplace. Owing to the pandemic, all meetings were held digi- tally in 2020 and inspections were conducted with appropriate safeguards in place. The con- tinuing education and training measures were limited to systematic activities, and specifically those relating to occupational safety and health, which totalled 1,112 in the business year 2020. In addition, the Work Safety Committee at each plant meets four times a year. Approximately four percent of the entire company workforce FOCUS ON COVID-19 PREVENTION [GRI 403-8] The > pandemic made 2020 an exceptionally challenging year in terms of occupational safety and health at Miele. The company needed to maintain business oper- ations while at the same time protecting employees. The measures taken were guided by the SARS-CoV-2 occupational safety stand- ards published by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and further official rules (including the ordinances enacted by the German states to curb the pandemic) and went beyond the legal requirements in some cases. Various interdepartmental and local teams were formed to help fight the virus, map- ping out actions and solutions and taking over responsibility for communication within 73  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES HR management Occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety the company. A dedicated section of the intranet was set up to provide additional information on current developments, help with people\\u2019s day-to-day work and answer many questions from employees.

WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS Reportable workplace accidents 187 200 2019 2020 Employees with office workstations were asked to work from home for a short time. Those who had to continue working on-site were required to wear face masks as soon as they left their workstations. Beyond that, masks were required for all workstations where social distance of 1.5 meters could not be maintained. In production, employees were divided into shift groups, and break times were staggered to minimise contact. Workplace accidents per one million working hours 2019 2020 9.9 10.5 Hand sanitiser and disinfectant dispensers were installed across the board, and social distancing markings were placed on the floor at all building entrances and exits. The cafe terias were temporarily closed and then reopened with special hygiene and col- lection concepts. Occupancy limits were put in place for offices and meeting rooms to ensure sufficient distance. Wherever minimum distances could not be main- tained, such as in production, partitions were installed. Most meetings were held online rather than in person. Beyond that, the occupational health and safety officers worked with the plant medical service to offer advice on events. Multiple testing sta- tions were set up at the plants, offering Miele employees the chance to be tested for the virus several times a week.

In the course of these activities, supervisors, occupational safety special- ists, safety officers, company medical officers, and works council members were all asked to update risk assessments and define imme- diate actions to take in case of emergency. Since Miele is a production company with a high level of vertical integration, some of the jobs carry health risks or are particu- larly hazardous, such as those involved in the surface treatment of materials and in metal- working. Numerous measures are taken to eliminate or mitigate risks, from risk assess- ments of workstations and psychological strain, some of which are required by law, to protective clothing and training activ- ities aimed at preventing accidents. Training, posted notices and app notifica- tions advise employees when there is any change in the required protective measures. In addition, employees can report any dan- gers directly to their supervisor during daily team meetings. External companies and their employees who enter Miele grounds receive timely information from Miele about the occu- pational safety requirements that apply there. FIRST AID IN EMERGENCIES AND ACUTE CASES [GRI 403-3] A plant medical service has been in place since 1973 in G\\u00fctersloh. Along with the legal duties which result from the Occupational Safety Act, the plant med- ical service also takes care of first aid in the event of emergencies and acute illnesses. They work together with the Miele com- pany insurance provider BKK to provide and actively promote the annual influenza vaccination. At all other sites, insurance-ac- credited physicians and medical personnel ensure that employees receive proper care.

The other sites also held Health Day events focusing on topics such as healthy eating, coping with stress, protecting one\\u2019s skin, restful sleep and cardiovascular disease. Over 6,400 people participated in these occupa- tional health management activities across all German sites in 2019. All events and courses were initially cancelled at the start of the pandemic, in 2020, but they were then gradually brought back in online for- mats. This was the reason for the significant decrease in the total number of participants. Closely linked with Miele\\u2019s occupational health management activities, the company also engages in occupational integration management at all German sites (plants and sales and service centres). It is intended to make it easier for employees who have suffered from lengthy periods of illness to return to their jobs. 900 managers have participated in qualification seminars on the topic of \\u201cHealthy Management\\u201d. of them support employees in relation to var- ious health-related topics, like healthy eating and coping with depression and addiction. In Switzerland, Miele offers its workforce at the showroom in Crissier a gym membership. In China, the Baltic States, the Netherlands and Sweden as well, the Miele sites sup- port sports activities and the health of their employees. In Russia, monthly seminars are offered on maintaining a healthy work- life balance, with topics including things like coping with stress and healthy eating. and health. Over 900 managers \\u2013 the vast majority \\u2013 have participated since the seminars were first offered, in 2015. At the Bielefeld, G\\u00fctersloh and Oelde sites, managers who work in production receive additional training on how to wel- come new employees in a spirit of respect and appreciation. Miele also ensures that managers develop an eye for proper ergo- nomic working. In this way, they can help employees work more ergonomi- cally, including with help from the health management team where needed. LIFE COACHING AND ADDICTION COUNSELLING [GRI 404-2] Miele began offering employees at the German plants the option to seek life coaching and addiction counselling in early 2014. Trained contact persons are available to provide assistance. In addition, a 24-hour counselling hotline is also available through a service provider to handle crisis situa- tions. The two counsellors in G\\u00fctersloh alone logged some 400 consultations from mid-2019 to mid-2020. Frequent topics include work- place incidents, psychological strain and family issues. Beyond the counselling itself, smoking cessation programmes have also been offered. SPECIAL PROGRAMMES FOR APPRENTICES AND TRAINEES Promoting health is also an integral fea- ture of vocational training activities at Miele. All apprentices and trainees participate in five required events as part of the health insur- ance programme \\u201cAzubi fit\\u201d. These include an introduction to occupational health and a seminar on maintaining a healthy back. During this reporting period, the programme was also expanded to include identifying and coping with stress or addiction. All pro- gramme activities moved online in 2020. Technical apprentices also attend training ses- sions offered by professional associations. WIDE RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS Miele offers extensive occupational health management measures for employees at international locations as well.

For this reason, Miele continues to collaborate with schools and universities in the vicinity of the locations. ENTRY OPPORTUNITIES AT MIELE School pupils and leavers All employees benefit from a wide range of training and qualification options. In Germany, the company invested 17 million euros in vocational training and further development in the calendar year 2020 (calendar year 2019: 18.1 million). Against the backdrop of an > ageing population, the company\\u2019s focus lies increasingly on measures aimed at ensuring performance and employability in the long term. Students DIVERSE ENTRY-LEVEL POSITIONS FOR YOUNG PROFESSIONALS Graduates with Bachelor\\u2019s and Master\\u2019s degree Miele offers talented young professionals numerous opportunities for joining the com- pany.

The number of apprenticeships and positions for stu- dents in dual study programmes at Miele is determined by the company\\u2019s requirements in consultation with the departments as part of the strategic human resources plan- ning process. Once they have completed their training, Miele offers all apprentices an employment contract for a minimum of one year or even a permanent contract. continue to be made available to appren- tices in the future. A wide range of hands-on opportunities for technical apprentices have been created at the sales subsidi- aries in Ireland and Italy and at the plant in B\\u00fcrmoos, Austria. In all, eleven appren- tices and trainees, eleven students enrolled in dual programmes, and two interns spent time abroad during the reporting period. AWARDS FOR GRADUATES AND NEW PATHS TO VOCATIONAL TRAINING not only an electrical systems installer voca- tional training track, but also a business traineeship toward certification as a manage- ment assistant in industry. The quality of Miele\\u2019s programmes for young professionals was confirmed in 2020 by the Clevis corporate consultancy. Miele was ranked second in a study of the best German employers for young professionals and named \\u201cRising Star of the Year\\u201d (Aufsteiger des Jahres) for its dramatically improved ranking. When training its young professionals, Miele is careful to ensure that they develop digital skills and then apply them at the company. During this reporting period, for example, two new dual programmes with a focus on digital aspects were introduced. The \\u201cDigital Technologies\\u201d programme gives partici- pants extensive professional knowledge and skills relating to advanced informa- tion and communication technologies and fundamental knowledge of engineering. The \\u201cDigital Business Management\\u201d pro- gramme offers a broad-based education in business administration, expanding on the fundamentals of traditional business administration and adding solid IT-related basics. Three students started in these dual programmes in September 2020. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR APPRENTICES AND STUDENTS Gathering international experience is playing an ever greater role in training at Miele, which is why more assignments abroad will 459 apprentices and trainees in Germany at the start of vocational training in September 2020 The high quality of training at Miele is regularly confirmed externally. In the business years 2019 and 2020, a total of 33 apprentices in Germany passed their final exams with flying colours, earning the best possible marks. Nine of them were also named \\u201cbest in chamber\\u201d (Kammerbeste) by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. As part of the \\u201cCollective Labour Agreement for the Promotion of Apprenticeship Profi- ciency\\u201d (Tarifvertrag zur F\\u00f6rderung der Ausbildungsf\\u00e4higkeit), Miele offers internships to disadvantaged young people and those with lower academic performance. The objective is to open up a path for them into vocational training. Since 2009, this pro- gramme has successfully helped prepare 22 young people for an apprenticeship at Miele. In the business year 2019, two young men successfully completed the programme. Both began training to become industrial mechanics in September 2019. In 2020, two young men also started their training after successfully completing their internships. This was the first year that candidates were offered DUAL STUDY PROGRAMMES AT MIELE Since 1995, Miele has been offering school graduates the opportunity to complete var- ious commercial and technical dual study programmes in fields such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or busi- ness informatics. During the reporting period, 54 graduates successfully completed their dual study programmes, with over 80 per- cent of them going on to be hired by Miele. PROGRAMMES FOR UNIVERSITY GRADUATES Miele offers attractive entry-level opportunities for specialists and managers with an aca- demic background. Along with direct entry, there are two further entry-level programmes for graduates with bachelor\\u2019s degrees: The Master@Miele programme is a part-time master\\u2019s degree programme, usually with a technical focus. The Junior Sales Represent- ative Programme for entry into sales is also open to recruits who have not followed a tra- ditional career path. The programme gives talented candidates from other industries or 77  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement disciplines the opportunity to become junior sales representatives within just one year. INTERNSHIPS, SCHOLARSHIPS AND UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS During the reporting period, Miele offered more than 250 internships and thesis super- vision positions each year. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company was able to continue to offer internships and coop- erative relationships focusing on thesis projects. Most internships were con- ducted both on-site and through remote work on an alternating basis, with pro- fessional supervision at all times. Miele stays in close contact with selected technical and business-oriented universities around the world with the aim of contacting future applicants at an early stage and in a targeted manner. For example, the com- pany assigns practical projects to students, organises application and assessment centre training and offers excursions. In the reporting period, Miele was represented once more at numerous trade fairs for stu- dents, graduates and young professionals. In 2020, Miele shifted its participation in recruiting fairs to a different model. After a several-month phase when all fairs were cancelled by organisers and participating companies due to the pandemic, a shift toward digital formats began to take shape around the middle of the year. Miele partic- ipated in smaller events in this space, with up to 50 attendees. These new dialogue for- mats proved to be a good way to open up direct lines of communication with low bar- riers to entry, and Miele was able to recruit young professionals through these avenues. In its home region of eastern Westphalia, Miele offers ten scholarships a year to espe- cially talented candidates as part of the Deutschlandstipendium programme, com- bining them with social engagement and measures to support talented candidates. The Chinese plant in Dongguan awards four scholarships every year to students from the Dongguan Technology College who stand out as a result of their out- standing performance. Priority is given to students from less privileged back- grounds who perform at the same level. WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FOR TRAINING AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT [GRI 404-1/-2] A variety of training pro- grammes make a pivotal contribution to continuing to ensure the company\\u2019s suc- cess in the future. The responsibility for these programmes lies with the training divi- sion. Miele is involved in various different initiatives to get prospective young pro- fessionals interested in the company at an early stage. For example, the company participates in Girls\\u2019 Day. Its interna- tional trainee programme is one way Miele is putting its global focus into practice. HR development at Miele has an interna- tional focus. Succession management, for example, follows a uniform, IT-supported pro- cess throughout the company, which allows an overall view of all management posi- tions and makes it possible to come up with the best succession solutions for cer- tain people or positions early on. Part-time further training is of particular strategic sig- nificance to the company. To hold our own and continue to innovate, we need to pro- vide targeted support for employees to reach their full potential. Key development pro- grammes for talented professionals and to provide training for managers are increas- ingly being expanded internationally. In the process, Miele does not focus solely on specific on-the-job requirements, but also takes employees\\u2019 individual skills and aptitudes into account. Measures to sup- port employees\\u2019 growth and development at Miele include the following in particular: Systematic further training and advancement of skilled personnel and managers from within the company Continuous development and expansion of an international talent management process Goal-oriented HR development measures for specific target groups Ensuring internal knowledge management and employee networking Standardisation of learning processes across all locations Further development at Miele is a standardised process and is supported by a learning man- agement system (LMS) software solution that is 8.9 hours were spent by Miele employees on development on average in 2020. increasingly being used internationally as well. Opportunities for further training are planned and documented via the LMS, giving managers an overview of the progress that employees are making with their further development. Learning plans document the qualification measures planned for employees as well as the ones they have already completed. In addition, Miele intro- duced an online evaluation of further training measures in the 2019\\u20132020 period. Participants reported average satisfaction levels with their training measures of more than 5.2 on a scale from 1 to 6, with 6 being the highest possible rating. Ninety-five percent of respondents would recommend Miele\\u2019s training measures to others. The \\u201cMiele Change Agent\\u201d is one element of the LMS. This digital training format is part of the extensive worldwide learning and sup- port options offered in the Design2Excellence programme, preparing employees for the > transformation of Miele that is associated with the programme. About 30 people com- pleted the course during this reporting period. 78  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT CYCLE l t i f t On-the-job implementation, consolidation Q u alifi catio n m easures Planning and budgetary approval of needs-based qualification ployee review m E D e t e r m i n i n g i o n a l e d u c a t n e e d s R e c ordin alifi q u g n e atio c e d s-b n in L a s e d M S The annual employee review, which brings together managers and employees to dis- cuss performance, is another tool for managing the need for professional development based on specific job and skill requirements. DIGITAL LEARNING Miele made further strides in adopting dig- ital learning technologies in 2020. Working in tandem with external training institutions, the company shifted almost all areas of its training activities to digital learning formats. This allowed Miele to meet employees\\u2019 edu- cation needs even without holding in-person events. Things like LinkedIn Learning were helpful here. This extensive digital learning platform offered by professional social network LinkedIn has been available to Miele employees since January 2020. The \\u201cDigital Fitness\\u201d training initiative was also launched in 2020. Its goal is to raise awareness of the digital transformation among all employees and boost digital skills at the company. Plans call for the programme to be expanded further in the years to come. TEACHING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS \\u2013 AND ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE [GRI 404-2] Within the scope of its internal further training programmes, Miele pro- vides qualification opportunities for various fields such as management, project and change management, or IT applications. Miele bases various overarching, central qualification topics and specific qualification measures on its Miele competency model, which describes the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to be successful at the company. Through job descrip- tions, the model provides career planning assistance, for example. Miele also offers employees the opportunity to advance their management skills internationally. A very broad range of options are offered for advancing technical and professional skills. Miele uses a certified project man- agement training programme from the International Project Management Associ- ation (IPMA). The company introduced the programme in product development back in 2010, to great success, and has now been expanding it to other areas of the company. Certified project managers can manage complex projects with excellent structure and organisation and have a shared under- standing of how projects are executed at the Group level. The crucial factor is that many projects are growing increasingly com- plex, even those outside traditional product development. Miele now has more than 200 employees trained as project managers. In addition, employees in Germany have the opportunity to further their education by attending external training events in their areas of expertise. Miele also expressly supports any employees who wish to take part in part-time further training on their own initiative. The company provides finan- cial support for accredited, part-time further training courses or degree pro- grammes. Forty-four employees made use of this option during the reporting period. 79  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Miele also relies on experienced employees to share their knowledge and expertise. As part of the Miele Mentoring Programme, experienced employees are matched with junior managers and specialists to pro- vide them with career guidance by offering advice, establishing contacts, assisting with project development and giving feedback. WIDE RANGE OF OPEN TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES [GRI 404-2] Open training remains an impor- tant supplementary part of the training and education opportunities offered at Miele. These options are geared towards all employees in Germany. Unlike the internal and external training options, these open training sessions are held during employees\\u2019 free time. Miele covers the cost of these sessions. In the business year 2019, exactly 2,691 employees took part. That number stood at just 1,086 in 2020. The decrease was because almost all of the planned sessions had to be cancelled in the spring of 2020 due to the pandemic. The sessions were shifted to digital learning formats for the autumn programme \\u2013 and participation figures rebounded. The pro- gramme saw a considerable shift during the reporting period, going from in-person sessions to mainly digital formats. COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATION Filling at least three out of four open man- agerial positions from within the company is one of Miele\\u2019s stated goals. Particular attention is therefore paid to promoting the development of managers. Employees who take on a managerial position for the first time are prepared extensively for their new role with the help of a binding qualifi- cation programme. Further opportunities for learning and gaining experience that focus on transferring practical experience and feedback are available to experienced managers. One new feature introduced in 2020 was the \\u201cVirtual Management\\u201d (\\u201cVir- tuell f\\u00fchren\\u201d) live online training series, which is offered for managers working from home. Agile management was another new topic introduced in 2020, debuting in the smart home segment. Twenty-six man- agers in that area spent approximately six months training for their new leadership role in the context of the agile transformation. The Miele Business Academy plays a key role in the company\\u2019s efforts to train and educate its managerial staff. Seminars are held in English, and participants come from all cor- ners of the Miele world. The Miele Business Academy now offers 19 different training and learning options for international man- agers with various levels of experience, covering key management topics and skills. The one hundredth participant successfully completed the \\u201cManagement & Leadership Compact\\u201d course in 2019. Fifty participants attended the six events held in this course in the calendar years 2019 and 2020 alone (equivalent to 494 days of participation). DIGITALISATION UNLOCKS ADVANCED FORMS OF TRAINING AND LEARNING All new apprentices and trainees have been equipped with mobile devices since September 2020. This allows them to use digital learning platforms and similar options on their own. The MLS (\\u201cMobile Learning in Smart Factories\\u201d) dig- ital learning platform was introduced for vocational training activities back in 2019. Apprentices can access specially prepared, company-specific learning content, allowing them to learn anytime, anywhere. This further enhances the quality of the training and education they receive. Thanks to these measures, Miele was able to continue to ensure the same solid, challenging types of vocational training in 2020, even amid the pandemic.

Miele views having a diverse international workforce as a valuable addition both on a human level and professionally. And it is precisely in a global company that diversity is also an impor- tant competitive factor to say the least. PROMOTING DIVERSITY, PREVENTING DISCRIMINATION than Germany. Citizens of Turkey, Greece, Italy and Poland accounted for the largest share. Employees with disabilities made up 6 percent of all Miele workers in Germany (in the business years 2019 and 2020). Miele participated in German Diversity Day once again in the reporting period. About 50 employees from eight coun- tries took part in this activity, which was held in May 2020. This time around, they presented their insights into diversity through a creative digital photo collage. used by women via the > \\u201cCrossMentoring OWL\\u201d network. There are also regular dialogue and networking formats, such as \\u201cWomen with Power of Attorney\\u201d (\\u201cFrauen in Vollmacht\\u201d) for people with these authorisations and additional specific groups like meetings of female engi- neers. As at the end of December 2019, women accounted for 22.3 percent of the German workforce. The figure for the year after that was 22.1 percent. Worldwide, women made up 29.7 percent of the staff at Miele as at 31 December 2020. accommodate this with its family-friendly working conditions. In November 2020, Miele launched a strategic project in Greece to fill more entry-level and managerial positions with women. Female workers accounted for 41 percent of the staff in Greece in 2020. [GRI 405-1] Miele aims to raise awareness throughout the company of the vast poten- tial lying in diverse life and work experiences, perspectives and values. The company phi- losophy, the Miele Code of Conduct and the company-wide agreement on the German General Equal Treatment Act form the Group-wide framework for cultivating diver- sity and equal opportunity and taking action against discrimination. The company has demonstrated its adherence to this idea towards external and internal audiences alike by obtaining > SA8000 certification and signing the Diversity Charter in 2012. In the business year 2020, 6.3 percent (2019: 6.0 percent) of Miele employees in Germany were citizens of a country other COMMITMENT TO FEMALE EMPLOYEES Furthering female talent is firmly rooted as a point of Miele\\u2019s corporate strategy in its own right. In keeping with this position, it is also a particular area of focus for the company\\u2019s diversity measures. Miele supports women\\u2019s careers through various concepts. Just like their male colleagues, every woman at Miele who is identified and designated as being especially talented receives a full spectrum of individual growth and development opportuni- ties. Alongside the internal mentoring programme, which matches talented individ- uals with an experienced Miele manager or specialist, those with high potential can also access external mentoring, which is primarily Increasing the number of women in manage- ment positions is a stated goal of the HR policy, both in Germany and internationally. A total of 11.3 percent of managerial positions in Germany and 24.4 percent of managerial positions worldwide were held by women at the end of 2020. Miele does not consider it appropriate to define a fixed quota for increasing the proportion of women in mana- gerial positions. Miele instead strives to recruit the most qualified candidate for each position that must be filled, regardless of gender. Female candidates displaying high potential are specifically supported and encouraged to set ambitious professional goals, as well as to keep pursuing these goals after having chil- dren, if they choose to do so.

In dual study programmes in Germany, women accounted for 21.3 percent that same year in technical fields and 41.7 percent in business fields. Supporting female employees plays a central role at Miele. 29.7% was the worldwide percentage of women in the overall Miele workforce in 2020. (As at 31 December 2020) New managers are trained individually, com- pleting a one-day training programme titled \\u201cLeading through Diversity\\u201d (\\u201cDiversity \\u2013 Vielfalt f\\u00fchren\\u201d). The goal of this programme is to spur efforts towards greater diversity in managers\\u2019 own teams and to tap into the potential that this diversity offers. NO DIFFERENCES IN THE SALARIES RECEIVED BY WOMEN AND MEN [GRI 405-2] Remuneration at Miele\\u2019s German sites takes place according to a person\\u2019s job and in keeping with collective agreements based on the framework pay agreement for the metal and electronics industry. Therefore, there are no differences in the remunera- tion of women and men at Miele. Merit pay is categorised and calculated strictly based on the specific task and actual performance and does not take unrelated criteria into account. Measures to ensure that employee pay does not differ based on gender or other diversity criteria are also in place at the com- pany\\u2019s international production sites. In the reporting period, Miele once again participated in the \\u201cWomen\\u2019s Career Index\\u201d project, which is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. Each year, the initiative highlights companies that take targeted action to provide fair career opportu- nities to women. The company is also committed to promoting female junior professionals, apprentices and trainees. In 2020, women made up 9.7 percent of those enrolled in technical vocational training and 60.2 percent of commercial apprentice- 12.2% women in technical apprenticeships; 57.4% women in commercial apprenticeships in Germany in September 2020 in relation to vocational training and the dual study programmes as a whole.

Right back to the company\\u2019s founders, Miele has always been aware of its responsibility for the well- being of employees and their families. A wide-ranging social engagement initiative has developed over the decades as a result of this care. Activities are largely focused on the regions surrounding the company sites. In this way, Miele helps to maintain a smooth-running, attractive environment. social engagement that apply to the sales sub- sidiaries chart the fundamental course for this. For example, the only donations permitted are to non-profit or charitable organisations. The responsible parties at the sales subsidiaries identify suitable projects themselves. Miele is in close communication with local communi- ties at all its locations and therefore has a good understanding of their needs. Miele wishes to be a reliable partner for the local authorities, associations and initiatives. With this in mind, it aims to support projects on a long-term basis, wherever possible. In special cases, this engagement, which is focused on continuity, is supplemented by flexible, short-term support. \\u20ac 175,000 \\u20ac were used for donations in 2020. In 2019, the Miele Foundation took part in social projects and initiatives amounting to around 97,000 euros. In 2020, the donation volume was much lower, at 50,000 euros, since many events were can- celled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. SUPPORTING FAMILIES Supporting and improving the oppor- tunities of young people from the areas surrounding the Miele sites has always been a key aspect of Miele\\u2019s social engagement. ENGAGEMENT BY THE COMPANY AND THE MIELE FOUNDATION Miele\\u2019s social activities are aimed at sup- porting youth and families and at education and culture. This applies not only to Miele as a company, but also to the foundation of the same name, which was established in 1974. While the explicit development goal of the Miele Foundation\\u2019s charter is the pro- motion of public welfare in the German city of G\\u00fctersloh, the company itself addresses a broader range of needs and also pursues active social engagement at other plant sites. The international sales subsidiaries also engage in diverse initiatives. The guidelines on FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABILITY Miele takes a very broad view of sustainability, in line with the 17 Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations. The international sales subsidi- aries also engage in extremely diverse and sustainable initiatives. For example, Miele partnered with three artists in Switzerland in 2020 to stand against disposable \\u201cfast fashion\\u201d. The campaign, dubbed \\u201cSame Shirt Different\\u201d, invited participants to upcycle existing articles of clothing, cushions or bags with iron-on patches using the Fashion- Master steam ironing system from Miele. DONATIONS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD [GRI 201-1, 415-1] Traditionally, Miele supports a number of regional charities with an annual donation of money or items. The projects to be supported are decided upon by the respon- sible division depending on the urgency and requirements of the requests. Large donations need to be approved by the Executive Board. In the business year 2018/19, Miele & Cie. KG donated a total of 175,000 euros in Germany. In the business year 2020, which now matches the calendar year, approximately 175,000 euros in funding was used for dona- tion purposes again. Since 1976, the Miele Foundation has offered significant financial support to the G\\u00fcter- sloh Holiday Games for children between the ages of 5 and 17. Every year, this oppor- tunity includes many different and various activities that provide care during school holidays. Support for the project \\u201cJugend- integration durch Sport\\u201d (integrating young people through sport) is also provided through an annual donation. This pro- ject was launched by the department for children and youth development in the city of G\\u00fctersloh in 2009. It aims to pro- mote social skills in young people that are rarely gained from usual sporting activity. Activities include hip-hop courses for girls or mixed indoor football, for example. 83  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Since 2014, the company has supported the G\\u00fctersloh Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children with its \\u201cHand in Hand\\u201d family mentors project. In this project, volun- tary female family mentors visit families for a few hours each week to support the chil- dren and parents in difficult times. In 2019, 24 families received support from 24 men- tors in all. The figure for 2020 was 22 families. DIGITALISATION AND SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION STRENGTHENING CULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES Diverse cultural opportunities contribute sig- nificantly to making a region attractive and increasing the local quality of life. Therefore, an important element of Miele\\u2019s engagement has traditionally been to promote culture. In this reporting period, the company once again supported the Westf\\u00e4lische Kammerphil- harmonie ensemble, which is composed of members of well-known German orchestras, independent musicians and especially qualified students, an approach that stands out from the rest of the German orchestra landscape. To comply with its regional responsibili- ties, Miele also supports the digital transition through initiatives such as the \\u201cDigitale Agenda G\\u00fctersloh\\u201d and its first digitalisa- tion strategy. This project is among the \\u201cSmart Cities Made in Germany\\u201d model pro- jects. As part of the initiative, the German federal government provides about 8.5 million euros in funding to support for- ward-looking projects in G\\u00fctersloh, out of a total volume of about 13 million euros. Like in previous years, Miele supported Kulturgemeinschaft Dreiecksplatz, an associ- ation that organises various cultural events in G\\u00fctersloh, in both 2019 and 2020. In August 2020, an event called \\u201cKlangwandel\\u201d was launched as a partnership between Kultur- gemeinschaft Dreiecksplatz and three other organisers. In the project, sound collages were created in public spaces by art- ists who would normally have appeared on an open-air stage in G\\u00fctersloh this year. A significant objective of Miele\\u2019s involvement in education is to inspire children and young people to get involved in technology and to introduce young adults to technical profes- sional fields. In the reporting period, Miele supported non-profit association \\u201cDas erste Buch e.V.\\u201d, which aims to foster and sup- port a culture of reading among children and teens while cultivating their creativity and self-confidence. Schoolchildren in G\\u00fcters loh wrote exciting stories as part of the pro- ject. A panel of judges selected the top entries, which were published in a collected volume with financial support from Miele. DONATIONS TO EASE THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE In response to the devastating wildfires in January 2020, employees of the sales subsidiary in Australia col- lected donations for a number of aims: to care for wildlife, restore destroyed habitats, and promote ecot- ourism in the affected areas. Many employees used social media to highlight the campaign for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia (WWF-Australia), which col- lected funds equivalent to nearly 34,000 euros in all.

At the same time, the scope covered by the key figures with regard to the participations and sales subsidiaries was changed. More information can be found in the respective footnotes. Due to these changes, the values for the calendar years 2019 and 2020 are of limited comparability with those of earlier business years. As a result, this report only presents the key figures for the past two calendar years.

The decline was primarily attributable to a reluctance to invest due to the uncertainties associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Over half of the total amount was invested in product development and in the expansion, conversion and modernisation of the international Miele Group production network. Miele also opened new flagship stores (Miele Experience Centers) at its sites in Sydney, Brussels and Sao Paolo, among others. These efforts were rounded out by the completion of the Miele Lounge at Munich\\u2019s Allianz Arena.

In G\\u00fctersloh, use of a stainless steel welding system also started, enhancing the level of vertical integration and leading to the creation of more stainless steel scrap. Lehrte saw investments in infrastructure, resulting in significant quantities of waste from excavated soil. In Uni\\u010dov, the ramp-up of a wash cabinet production process for dishwashers also led to an increase in metal scrap, which had a marked effect on the amount of waste. 1) The waste disposal method was determined on the basis of information provided by the waste disposal provider.

Moreover, the new plant in Poland was taken into account in the recording of data for the first time in 2020. Another reason for the increased water consumption is the dry summer and the necessary watering of green spaces as a result. 1) Water consumption is measured using water meters and taken from the energy reports from the energy management system. 2) Rainwater which is stored in cisterns or other similar containers and fed into a separate water system.

According to the location-based method, the values for the business year 2019 stood at 132,018 tonnes of CO2-equivalent and 128,646 tonnes of CO2-equivalent for 2020. The emission factors for 2019 from the German PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) were used to perform calculations in line with the location-based method. Alternatively, emission factors from the British Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) were also used. Total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions fell by 40 percent year on year in 2020. The decline in direct emissions (Scope 1) stood at 8 percent due to reduced natural gas and heating oil consumption, as well as the Covid-19-related reduction in mileage and the associated CO2 emissions of the company\\u2019s own vehicles. At 65 percent, the reduction in indirect emissions (Scope 2) was significantly higher, primarily as a result of the switch to green electricity. In 2020, 86 percent of the Miele locations worldwide covered their electricity needs with renewable energy. Moreover, electricity and district heat consumption fell further year on year across the Group. 1) The scope was expanded in 2019 to cover all production sites and sales subsidiaries, as well as the participations Steelco and Yujin. 2) Deviations of the total of the individual amounts from the entire figure in question are attributable to rounding. 3) Presentation of greenhouse gas emissions expanded from CO2 to CO2-equivalent, with CH4 and N20 being taken into account in addition to CO2 Emissions from volatile gases were considered irrelevant following a materiality analysis. 4) The calculation method used for the fleet was switched from the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to real consumption, with an uncertainty factor of 10 percent included for locations not previously taken into account.

Overall, their number increased by 4.2 percent compared to 30 June 2018, corresponding to a rise of 846 persons. Of that total, 299 came by way of the participations, which, with the exception of Steelco, were not part of the Miele Group in 2018. Steelco itself grew by 136 persons. Due to a combination of relocation and growth, new locations in Poland and the Netherlands were set up. Moreover, existing locations, such as the plant in Uni\\u010dov, saw substantial growth. As a result, the percentage of persons employed outside Germany increased from 46 to 47.2 percent.

CONTENTS 119119  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES About this report Miele has been publishing sustainability reports since 2002. This report, the tenth of its kind, documents the compa- ny\\u2019s progress in line with the Miele sustainability strategy and the guiding principle \\u201cForever Better\\u201d. The objective of the 2021 report is to make the performance of the company in sustainability-related matters transparent to stakeholders such as sustainability experts, customers, employees and business partners. The content reflects the main sustaina- bility issues affecting the company. These issues were most recently identified in 2018 in the course of a materiality anal- ysis and were weighted according to their relevance for Miele. [GRI 102-54] Miele\\u2019s reporting on sustainability is geared towards the internationally recognised standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This report was prepared in accordance with the Core option of the GRI standards. To meet stakeholders\\u2019 needs for information optimally, the report also includes additional information. Refer- ences to the individual GRI indicators are associated with the key figures and the relevant passages in the text. The GRI content index is found at the end of this report. The structure of this report follows that of the preceding report, which was issued in 2019. Its four main chapters \\u2013 Management & processes, Products & services, Supply chain & production and Employees & society \\u2013 also reflect the fields of action and focal points of the Miele sustainability strategy, which was further refined during this reporting period. This makes it easier to see how the measures described in the subchapters contribute to meeting the strategic targets. PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION [GRI 102-45/-50] Unlike the previous report, the Sustainability Report 2021 relates not to the last two business years at Miele (each of which ended on 30 June), but rather to the preceding calendar years. This is because the Miele busi- ness year was shifted to the calendar year in 2020. As a result, the reporting period runs from 1 January 2019 until 31 December 2020. Beyond that, key content from the second half of 2018 was also taken into account. The edito- rial deadline was in September 2021. Relevant occurrences noted by then were included in the report. Unless other- wise stated, all information, including key figures, refers to Miele & Cie. KG and its subsidiary Imperial-Werke oHG. This includes all German production and administrative sites, as well as sales and service in Germany. It also encom- passes \\u2013 under the umbrella of Miele Beteiligungs-GmbH \\u2013 the production sites in Bra\\u015fov (Romania), B\\u00fcrmoos (Austria), Dongguan (China), Ksawer\\u00f3w (Poland) and Uni\\u010dov (Czech Republic), along with the international sales subsidiaries. [GRI 102-10/-48/-49] During the reporting period, there were significant changes in relation to the size and > structure of the Group. A second washing machine plant com- menced operations in Ksawer\\u00f3w at the end of 2019, for example. The relocation of part of production operations from the B\\u00fcrmoos plant (manufacturing of medical products) to Steelco S.p.A., a subsidiary in Italy, was also concluded in 2019. In addition, the subsidiary Miele Venture Cap- ital GmbH acquired stakes in the following companies or increased its existing stakes in these companies during the reporting period: Agrilution Systems GmbH, MChef EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Verwaltungs-GmbH and MChef GmbH & Co. KG, Miele Operations & Payment Solutions GmbH, WaschMal GmbH, KptnCook Corp., Plant Jammer ApS and loadbee GmbH. Miele Venture Capital GmbH and its subsidiaries and sharehold- ings, as well as Steelco S.p.A. and Yujin Robot Co., Ltd, are not yet fully reflected in this report except where noted sep- arately, such as in > the company profile and > key figures. The Miele Sustainability Report is available > online as a PDF file. A detailed listing of key figures appears in the \\u201cFacts & figures\\u201d section at the end of the report. The sustainability website also offers customers and the public at large an overview of the Miele sustainability philosophy and how it is put into practice. It is available at > www.miele.com/sustainability and via Miele.de or Miele.com. The use of the full legal forms throughout the text has been avoided for the sake of greater readability.

SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 121 \",\n          \"General information . Describe your business model (including business object, products/services) . For more than 30 years, the CVH Group, with its locations throughout Germany in Hanover, Hamburg, Berlin and Magdeburg, has been committed to providing fast, reliable supplies of basic and specialty chemicals. In addition, the focus is on application engineering consulting and the acquisition of usable residual materials. Two key criteria of our philosophy are to place people at the centre of our actions and sustainably deal with resources. Therefore, we participate in the Responsible Care Programme and have an energy management system. Economic decisions are made with regard to sustainability. Within this framework, each of our 120 employees is also committed to environmentally conscious action. In the 2018 financial year, an annual turnover of EUR 75 million was achieved.\\\"The success of our customers is our success and sustainability is a common success factor.\\\" . Additional remarks: . Energy Management 50001 The CVH Group has implemented an energy management system throughout the company and has successfully been certified in accordance with ISO 50001:2011. Responsible Care Responsible Care is a worldwide program for the safe handling of chemicals. The entire CVH Group has been participating in the Responsible Care program of the Chemical Trade Association for more than 20 years. ISO 9001:2015 The ongoing work on our certified QM system naturally also includes the constant adaptation to the current state of the standard, whether it be to the process-oriented revision in 2008 or to the upcoming risk-based version DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 (already carried out, current data available) ESAD II (European Single Assessment Document) This is a standardized catalogue of questions developed from the Resposible Care program. The catalogue of questions covers the topics of safety, health, environmental protection and quality. . 1. Strategic analysis and measures . The company discloses whether it pursues a sustainability strategy and explains what concrete measures it is taking to operate in accordance with the essential and recognised industry-specific, national and international standards. . Our initiative for sustainability covers the areas of social responsibility, environmental protection, health and product safety. From this we are currently developing a sustainability strategy. The goal of the CVH Group is to be the most sustainable chemical distributor in Germany. Social responsibility Compliance with the social standards is a matter of course and mandatory for all employees. CVH is committed to the preservation of ethics and morals. This includes compliance with statutory regulations and prohibitions as well as compliance with self-imposed codes of conduct (compliance) and competition law. But also a targeted development of employees and the creation of an optimal working environment are an essential part of our social responsibility. In addition, the CVH Group promotes projects for child care and youth care at home and abroad. Environmental protection Through conversions to more efficient products at our customers and the use of modern measuring and dosing technology, the use of chemicals can be significantly reduced. The associated saving of resources is another important contribution to protecting our environment. Health By switching to more efficient products and training our customers' staff in handling hazardous substances, we not only want to reduce the environmental impact as much as possible, but also to reduce potential sources of danger for individual employees when handling chemicals. Our modern fleet of vehicles also contributes to the safe transport of dangerous substances and the likelihood of an accident to a minimum. Product safety The safe handling of hazardous substances has always been an important concern of CVH and is constantly being pursued by the exchange of problematic hazardous substances with customers and the use of intelligent packaging solutions. This not only leads to a safe handling of chemicals, but can also lead to a higher security of supply in certain areas of application. In this way, legal requirements or limited capacities of producers are taken into account. . 2. Materiality . The company discloses which aspects of its own business activities have a significant impact on aspects of sustainability and the significant impact the aspects of sustainability have on its business activities. It analyses the positive and negative effects and indicates how these findings are incorporated into its own processes. . The concept of sustainability is firmly anchored in our company policy. Participation in the Responsible Care Programme of the German Chemical Trade Association (VCH) documents our self-contribution to a responsible handling of chemicals towards customers, suppliers, authorities and our fellow citizens, oriented towards safety and environmental protection. In the chemical trade there are not only opportunities that arise from our sustainability idea, but also risks in which one becomes more expensive by sustainable solutions to competitors to lose. Nevertheless, many possibilities arise from sustainable activities. Customers who are subject to the CSR reporting obligation of the EU can be bound to the company more closely. In addition, one can not gain sustainability from sustainability, e.g. customers their previous suppliers. Therefore, for us the opportunities that result from the sustainability aspect in relation to our business activities prevail. The following topics have influence on our business activities: logistics, product optimization, services and water treatment. Logistics In the area of logistics, we attach importance to environmentally friendly packaging solutions which can achieve packaging savings. This is realized by our deposit system. In addition, we are continuously working on a fleet optimization. Product optimization Product optimization includes, for example, the exchange of problematic hazardous materials by less dangerous products, an application-technical consulting regarding the use of chemicals, product training as well as the planning and installation of the ideal extraction technology for chemicals.ServicesWe support our customers in the proper utilization of the residual materials with the help of approved disposal partners and advise on all problems from the field of disposal. In addition, we take back contaminated solvents for recycling within the framework of the circular management law.Water treatmentThe focus of water treatment is on saving fresh water by treating waste and cooling water and using modern measuring, dosing and control technology. . Product management; employee training/further training; customer loyalty; data protection/data security; behaviour compliant with law and guidelines; revenue management; stakeholder dialogue; responsible management of resources . Objectives . The company discloses which qualitative and/or quantitative as well as time-defined sustainability goals are set and operationalized and how their level of achievement is controlled. . The CVH Group is committed to implementing a sustainability initiative in sales and procurement. This means in concrete terms that an 8% reduction in energy consumption between 2016 and 2020 (each year 2%) is to be achieved. In addition, the energy management system DIN:ISO 50001 aims to determine savings potentials, whose implementation and costs are to be examined and, if necessary, implemented. Our fleet is up to date. We only use new generation trucks with Euro 6 engines. Reducing fleet consumption and emissions is an important point in terms of our sustainability goals. All trucks have installed the so-called Fleetboard system from Mercedes. This system is used for efficient tour planning and also enables an operational analysis. Based on this application analysis, the driving behaviour can be evaluated monthly. The system awards grades of 1-10 and evaluates, among other things, predictive driving, wear and fuel consumption. Our sustainability initiative is also based on the United Nations Agenda 2030. With the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, however, wholesalers do not have a direct influence on all of these goals. However, with the choice of our suppliers and customers, we contribute to these goals in terms of sustainability and support through sponsorships in cooperation with the organization Plan International Children in developing countries. In addition, we are committed, for example, to promoting associations in the region. Our sustainability goals are basically controlled by our management. Nevertheless, every employee is committed to controlling himself and his colleagues. In addition, internal and external audits on certifications such as Responsible Care, ISO 50001:2011, SQAS/ ESAD II, ISO 9001:2015 ensure independent strategic control of our set sustainability goals. . 4. Depth of the value chain . The company specifies the importance of sustainability aspects for value creation and to what depth of its value chain sustainability criteria are reviewed. . The value chain of CVH Chemie-Vertrieb GmbH & Co. Hannover KG is characterized by the supply of basic and special chemicals to customers. We meet special requirements with our services. Through the personal contact of the customer managers with the customers, topics such as procurement, quality, supply security, individual problem solutions as well as application technical questions can be clarified. The responsibility of our company extends according to the thought of the Responsible Care from the procurement to the use phase up to its controlled disposal. In principle, the principle of sustainable development is anchored in the integrated management manual. Supportingly, processes, procedures and work instructions describe responsible and sustainable action. The requirements are applied in the corporate divisions and continuously intensified. Problems regarding sustainability in business relations with customers or suppliers are openly communicated and solved by our customer managers/purchaser and sales representatives in cooperation. In addition, external and internal audits identify problems and dangers and solve them together. The value chain includes: Contact with the customer: Requirements for the product such as quality, price and date, End-of-life declarations Procurement, service and sales: Core processes and thus the central business of CVH, selection of responsible manufacturers and suppliers, monitoring of the supply chain with regard to the environment, production conditions and transport routes, testing and selection of an appropriate service provider taking into account the feasibility and costs, consideration of aspects such as responsible care, environmental aspects of the customer as well as legal requirements for storage and handling hazardous substances, transmission of product specifications, safety data sheets, analysis certificates or factory certificates Logistics: through own fleet or external freight forwarders, through load records of trucks and fleetboard systems, the emissions associated with delivery are improved and minimized Recovery and disposal of chemicals: professional disposal and recycling taking into account environmental protection Building management: ongoing optimisation of energy efficiency Concrete goals and measures are defined by performance indicators and tracked and evaluated by the QS circle. Through the publication of the Responsible Annual Report, we pass on our understanding of consistency and the results of our suggestions to interested parties and customers. Internal and external audits as well as a complaint management serve as supporting processes for responsible and environmentally conscious action. Feedback in customer satisfaction analyses enables all business areas to be continuously improved and reoriented. . Performance indicators for criteria 1 to 4 . Vehicle fleet Consumption optimization by Fleetboard Application analysis . With regard to vehicle fleet consumption optimization, the driving behaviour is evaluated monthly. These evaluations raise our drivers' awareness of their driving behaviour and show them on a monthly basis where there is need for improvement. . Internal indicators . Services, waste . 5. Responsibility . The responsibilities in corporate management for sustainability are disclosed. . The responsibility lies with the management or with the management in the locations, i.e. at the top management level. The sustainability program was also initiated by the management. Nevertheless, every employee of the CVH Group is committed to a sustainable and environmentally conscious action. For example, regular, internal training for the employees takes place. . 6. Rules and processes . The company discloses how the sustainability strategy is implemented through rules and processes in the operational business. . Chemie-Vertrieb GmbH & Co. Hannover KG has implemented its sustainability and corporate strategy in the form of process instructions into the ongoing business process. The integrated quality management system according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 ensures that all processes are documented and adapted if necessary. Regular internal quality management training/meetings for employees ensure that everyone involved in the business process can contribute their concerns to this system in order to continuously improve it. In addition, the Responsible Care Initiative of the chemical industry is an important basis for all business processes. This system is regularly reviewed both through internal and external audits. This ensures continuous further development, including environmental protection and work safety. Another important cornerstone of our sustainability strategy is the responsible use of resources. In the course of this, an energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001:2011 was implemented in the whole CVH group and in 2018 the most current energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001:2015 was introduced. Also, the use of a modern fleet and an efficient supply rhythm of our customers helps to save energy and reduces CO emissions to a large extent. Thus, not only resources are spared, but also the negative ecological effects are significantly minimized. The CVH group is also in a continuous improvement process. In addition, employees are stopped for waste separation and paper saving. . 7. Control . The company discloses how and which performance indicators are used for sustainability in regular internal planning and control. It explains how appropriate processes ensure reliability, comparability and consistency of data for internal control and external communication. . Energy demand divided by truck, passenger car, heating energy and electricity; emissions of CO2 emissions (by fleet); waste divided by hazardous and non-hazardous waste related to seizure at the customer; regular employee satisfaction analysis; accidents at work and resulting missing days; end-of-life declarations; employee training (training needs analysis) . Performance indicators on sustainability : Further performance indicators such as fluctuation rate and disease rate are also used for corporate controlling. In addition, the CVH Group regularly conducts internal and external audits, e.g.: DIN EN ISO 50001:2015, DIN EN ISO 9001:2015, Responsible Care, SQAS and Fami QS. . Performance indicators for criteria 5 to 7 . Performance Indicator G4-56 Describe the values, principles and standards of conduct and conduct (codes of conduct and ethics) of the organization. . CVH is aware of corporate social responsibility. Respect for human rights, fair working conditions, equal rights, equal opportunities and non-discrimination are guidelines for our business activities. CVH ensures that when selecting its suppliers, they are equally committed to these principles. CVH is committed to ensuring compliance with social standards. In Germany, corresponding laws and legislation, including the ban on the employment of children, the protection of working young people, the prohibition of forced labour, working time restrictions, freedom of association (e.g. of workers' organisations), occupational safety and equal opportunities, are regulated. Compliance with these regulations is a matter of course for the CVH Group and its employees operating in Germany and can be checked at any time by customers, suppliers or authorities. CVH is committed to the preservation of ethics and morals in business life and requires its employees to always act in accordance with the applicable law as well as the company's internal guidelines. This includes compliance with all legal regulations and prohibitions, the protection of business secrets and data protection, as well as compliance with self-imposed codes of conduct and competition law. CVH also requires its suppliers to feel obliged to these values. . Incentive schemes . The company discloses how the target agreements and remuneration for managers and employees are also oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and long-term value creation. It is disclosed to what extent the achievement of these goals is part of the evaluation of the top management level (CEO/CEO) by the supervisory board. . Sustainability is not yet a fixed or explicitly mentioned component in the target agreements and remunerations of our employees in the office. However, it is assumed that it is. Most importantly, commercial indicators are currently an indicator of the target agreements. Most of our employees receive a basic salary with a variable salary share that is oriented towards the raw profit. Cost savings can be achieved through efficient planning of tours and goods deliveries. This has a positive effect on the variable salary and thus represents an incentive for sustainable action. With our trucks drivers we have created a direct incentive. These receive premiums for a particularly efficient and predictive driving method. Driving is carried out with Fleetboard, a system that provides information on consumption, service life and braking behaviour, among other things. In addition, there is a non-monetary system. By commending the driving style of our drivers in monthly discussions, a motivational increase is achieved, which leads to our drivers continuously improving. The achievement of our sustainability goals is controlled by the shareholders at the advisory board meetings. The management of the CVH Group is obliged to submit an annual report to the advisory board. This report also addresses, among other things, the sustainability goals and certifications. Furthermore, the achievement of the goals is controlled by annual internal and external audits (e.g. ISO 50001:2011, ISO 2015:9001, Responsible Care). . Performance indicators for criterion 8 . Performance Indicator G4-51a Compensation Policy \\u2013 Report on the remuneration policy for the highest supervisory body and senior executives. . The highest supervisory body (advisory board) does not receive any remuneration. Like all other employees, the executives participate in the company's overall result via a variable salary share. . Performance Indicator G4-54 Specify the ratio of the annual remuneration of the highest paid employee in each country with significant business activities to the average level (median) of the total annual remuneration of all employees (excluding the highest paid employee) in the same country. . No figures are currently collected for this, as so far not relevant. . 9. Participation of Stakeholder Groups . The company discloses how social and economically relevant stakeholders are identified and integrated into the sustainability process. It discloses whether and how a continuous dialogue with them is maintained and how its results are integrated into the sustainability process. . Economically relevant stakeholders are identified with the help of the quality management system. These include: - suppliers (certificates, audits) - customers (audits, final declarations) - employees - promotion of regional associations Gl\\u00fccksmesse e.V. - godmother - customer surveys - supplier discussions In dialogue with these stakeholders, an evaluation of e.g. suppliers - and customer surveys takes place regularly. In addition, during customer visits as well as supplier audits, the topic of sustainability in cooperation is discussed in principle, documented in reports and subsequently kept up with the resulting activities (CVH Initiative for Sustainability). In the course of changing market conditions, product and service developments as well as legal requirements, we see the further development of sustainability management as a continuous process. . Performance indicators for criterion 9 . Performance Indicator G4-27 Name the most important issues and concerns that have arisen through stakeholder involvement and how the organisation has responded to those important issues and concerns, including through reporting. Name the stakeholder groups that have addressed the key issues and concerns. . In cooperation with our customers, the topic of delivery bundling has arisen. The reason for this was isolated complaints about too high traffic volumes. For this reason, we also try to optimize the number of deliveries with other customers. Through regular customer satisfaction analyses, supplier surveys and employee satisfaction analyses, our stakeholders have the opportunity to inform us of their concerns. . 10. Innovation and product management . The company discloses how it contributes through appropriate processes to improving the sustainability of its own resource use and users through innovations in products and services. It also explains whether and how their current and future impact is assessed in the value chain and in the product lifecycle for the essential products and services. . As a wholesale trade, the main resource consumption results from buildings, vehicles and internal processes (e.g. IT) as well as indirectly from the product range. In order to create conditions for higher energy efficiency, modern, resource-efficient building and vehicle technology is continuously invested. In the course of this development, e.g. all illuminants were replaced by energy-saving LED bulbs. Each employee is encouraged by proper ventilation and heating to continuously minimize the gas consumption. Due to the economical handling of paper (bead-side printing, unused printed paper as a note/lubrication slip) paper wastes are to be avoided. Innovative fleetboard systems in the trucks as well as well thought-out route planning are to achieve an efficient and environmentally friendly driving method. An important aspect is the use of innovative packaging techniques (IBC, Safe-Tainer, etc.) that ensure the safe transport of chemicals. We take over the reliable distribution, bottling, storage and safe transport for the closed circuit systems with special double-walled safety containers (fass-in-container system). They enable an emission-free transfer of chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons for the sustainable protection of man and the environment. Thanks to our sustainable deposit system, all containers are pawned, subjected to cleaning after use and reused. In the Metaclean area, products are developed for special requirements and applications of our customers. Care is taken to ensure that the products are manufactured under the globally recognized safety and environmental standards. In dialogue with our business partners, sustainable development plays an important role for us along the value chain. It is very important to us that we work with our customers GEMEINSAM for a sustainable development of our business relationship. We do not come with a finished solution \\\" X\\\" instead optimizes our business in cooperation. Through an active cooperation and the common interest to make it as sustainable as possible, we help our customers, for example, to exchange dangerous products for their employees through harmless alternatives or special formulations. Through efficient tour planning in cooperation with our customers' buyers, it is also possible to bundle journeys, so that there are no routes for small quantities of goods. In the course of Responsible Care, the areas such as occupational health and health protection, environmental protection and transport safety are consolidated and improved by regular training and training. . Performance indicators for criterion 10 . Performance indicator G4-FS11 Percentage of financial assets subject to a positive or negative selection test according to environmental or social factors. . Financial investments are carried out exclusively at our parent companies. . 11. Utilization of natural resources . The company discloses the extent to which natural resources are used for business activities, including materials as well as the input and output of water, soil, waste, energy, area, biodiversity and emissions for the life cycle of products and services. . \\\"Sustainability as a common success factor.\\\" According to our sustainability initiative, we not only want to talk about this, but also integrate this idea firmly into all business processes. Our consumption consists of the use of electricity, gas and water for our office activities, as well as diesel and petrol as fuel for our own transporting truck fleet and external sales. With the introduction and certification of energy management according to DIN:ISO50001:2011, the above-mentioned consumptions and the associated CO emissions per location are recorded and evaluated. This ensures the necessary transparency with the problem zones can be optimized. Our goal is to continuously improve energy efficiency or reduce consumption. In the annual training sessions, employees are regularly sensitized with regard to the correct use of resources and are called upon to participate in process and process improvement. The behaviour, participation and schools of our employees are another key factor for continuous improvement. The CVH Group sells a wide range of basic and specialty chemicals. When selecting suppliers, particular attention is paid to manufacturing processes. This is to be done as energy-efficiently and sustainably as possible. These points are controlled by regular audits. In the context of Responsible Care, the CVH Group is obliged to analyse and minimize negative influences in the various processes of the value chain. This is also supported by our QM system. . 12. Resource management . The Company shall disclose the qualitative and quantitative objectives it has set for its resource efficiency, in particular the use of renewable energies, the increase in raw material productivity and the reduction of the use of ecosystem services, the measures and strategies it pursues, how they have been or are to be fulfilled in the future and where it sees risks. . CVH is committed to a sustainable energy policy and is committed to continuously reducing energy consumption, especially in the areas of passenger cars/trucks and buildings, as well as the associated CO emissions, in compliance with the statutory requirements. In order to achieve these goals, an energy management system DIN:ISO50001 was introduced together with the CG Group in the framework of a matrix certification. The reduction of the energy index (kWh/to warehouse sales) and the absolute values of electricity and natural gas across groups by 2020 has been reduced by 8%, in relation to 2015. In addition, the CVH Group strives for a continuous annual improvement of 2% in the procurement of the resources electricity and gas. In addition, special attention is paid to the origin (100% eco-electricity). Water consumption is limited to the one in the office building, as the CVH Group has no own production. Risks resulting from the business activities of our products and services are recorded in a risk management system annually reviewed and updated! Since we have no own production result the only risks from our transport business. . Performance indicators for criteria 11 to 12 . Performance indicator G4-EN1 Materials used by weight or volume. . No production takes place at our locations. Our suppliers take over the production, so no information can be provided on this. . Performance indicator G4-EN3 Energy consumption within the organisation. . - electricity consumption - electricity source 100% green electricity - fuel car / truck - gas consumption (heating) . Performance indicator G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption. . The goal is to reduce total energy consumption across groups by 8% by 2020, relative to 2015. All energy sources listed under the G4-EN3 power indicator are determined and evaluated quarterly. 2015: 3,365.259 kW/h 2018: 2,875.730 kW/h This results in a reduction of 14,55%. . Performance indicator G4-EN8 Total water abstraction by source. . At this time, there is no determination of the annual water consumption. The water consumption in the CVH group refers only to the operation of the sanitary installations and the collection of employees e.g. in kitchens. This water comes from the regional drinking water network. . Performance indicator G4-EN23 Total weight of waste by type and method of disposal. . There is no survey of the total weight of the waste, since it is only office waste that is handed over to the regional disposers. . 13. Climate-related emissions . The company discloses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol or standards based on it and sets its own emission reduction targets. . In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, there are two main emission sources in the CVH Group. Our fleet and the emissions generated in our locations with the consumption of gas and electricity. In the sense of our certified energy management system according to DIN:ISO50001:2011, the consumption of vehicles is recorded and the associated CO emissions per location are recorded and evaluated. This applies to all our vehicles trucks and cars. All trucks in the CVH Group fleet have installed the latest Euro 6 engines. In the new acquisition of vehicles, attention is also paid to the fact that each new vehicle emits less climate-relevant emissions than the predecessor. The emissions that occur in the sense of business activities in our offices are limited to the consumption of electricity and gas and the resulting output. CVH receives 100% green electricity from a local energy supplier. In order to reduce long-term electricity consumption, as possible all bulbs in LED lamps were changed in 2018. . Performance indicators for criterion 13 . Performance indicator G4-EN15 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1). . CO emissions are determined by the analysis of fuel consumption of cars/lorries, electricity consumption and the consumption of gas for heating systems. 2015: 1434 tonnes CO 2018: 1312 tonnes CO This corresponds to a reduction of 8.51% . G4-EN16 Indirect energy related GHG emissions (Scope 2). . For this purpose, the CVH Group does not collect any data, since the business activity only requires electricity, gas and water for the office and warehouse buildings. Thus, no above-average consumptions such as in industrial plants occur. The CVH Group obtains eco-electricity from regional energy suppliers. . Performance indicator G4-EN17 Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). . The CVH group does not collect data for this purpose (see: G4-EN16). . Performance indicator G4-EN19 Reduction of GHG emissions. . A continuous reduction of GHG emissions is one of our goals. For this purpose, data on consumption and associated GHG emissions are collected within the framework of the energy management system ISO:50001. See G4-EN6 & G4-EN15 performance indicator. . 14. Workers' rights . The company reports on how it complies with nationally and internationally recognised standards on employee rights and promotes the participation of employees in the company and in the company's sustainability management, which goals it sets itself, which results have been achieved so far and where it sees risks. . Respect for workers' rights is a fundamental issue in the philosophy of the CVH Group and is enshrined in our internal code of conduct. The CVH Group only operates nationally and respects the ILO core labour standards. Therefore, employees also get more holidays than is required by law. Through audit mechanisms of the integrated management system, it is ensured that all workers' rights are respected. In order to be able to compete, we need motivated and competent employees who work with our company. The satisfaction of the employees plays a decisive role in this, because employees who are placed in a positive position over their tasks make full use of their performance potential and thus ensure the long-term success of the CVH Group. The results of the employee satisfaction analyses serve as the basis for the introduction of suitable measures to improve employee satisfaction. The sensitization of the employees to the sustainability idea takes place in regular meetings. The risk of a fluctuation of well-trained employees goes in the CVH Group towards zero. . 15. Equal opportunities . The company discloses how it implements national and international processes and what goals it has to promote equal opportunities and diversity, occupational safety and health protection, participation, integration of migrants and people with disabilities, adequate pay and agreement of family and work, and how it implements them. .

Legal requirements are implemented and, in addition, - following the idea of Responsible Care - brought to the state of the art. Through targeted investments, we want to ensure maximum operational and occupational safety and to act economically sustainable. In order to promote the health of our employees, every employee can use free sports offers in a nearby fitness studio. The CVH Group pays all employees over-tariff. Every employee can participate in the company's development via a variable salary share. For our management, the principle that every employee in the company contributes significantly to the company's success is clear from our commission model. Reconciliation of family and work is very important to the CVH Group. By means of a working time model that allows half-day work, parental leave and an effortless transition back to full-day work, this is possible. In addition, the CVH Group attaches great importance to equality and the employment of people with disabilities. . (ii) the need to improve the quality of training; . The company discloses the objectives it has set and the measures it has taken to promote employability, i.e. the ability to participate in the working and professional world of all employees, and to adapt it to demographic trends, and where it sees risks. .

After exceeding our 2020 carbon emissions reduction target, we have set a vision of achieving net-zero by 2050, and we are working with the Science Based Targets initiative to determine the goals that support this vision. - From an innovation perspective, our Neptune liquid cooling technology, combined with our High-Performance Computing cluster, helps data center customers become more energy efficient. For example, they enable our customer, DreamWorks Animation, to cut power consumption by a third while increasing the amount of computing power per square foot of its existing data center by more than a hundredfold, which creates a real-time rendering process for creative artists. - Lenovo has continued its focus on resource preservation and supporting a circular economy by increasing the use of recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, increasing the use of bio-based materials, reducing the size of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and reusable packaging solutions that help to reduce carbon emissions. Since 2012, we have been using bamboo fiber in packaging, a renewable, bio-based and lightweight material. We have continued to increase our use of this material - , and are now using it in the packaging for more than one million products each year. In FY 2021/22, we expanded our use of bamboo fiber to include the ThinkPad X1 and Z series gift boxes, thus reducing the transportation weight by 30 percent. - During the last several years, the world has witnessed history quickly unfold as we live through significant complexity and uncertainty. Many of the persistent challenges that humanity has faced during this period require continued attention, including combating climate change, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19, and narrowing the digital divide. We are all learning to live with the new reality created by these challenges that continue to cause broader concerns about peace and prosp - erity for all. - We have continued to expand Lenovo\\u2019s renewable energy installation as we work to achieve our energy-related targets. The total in-operation renewable energy capacity in our worldwide locations has now reached approximately 17 megawatts, with more in the plan. - Furthermore, our efforts to effectively engage with suppliers on climate change were acknowledged when we achieved a CDP score of \\u201cA\\u201d for our 2021 Supplier Engagement Rating in Climate Change, and we were also listed on the Supplier Engagement Rating Leader Board along with a total of 518 companies. - This rapidly changing context urges the global business community to respond with smarter innovation and more responsible operations, seizing every opportunity to act with a larger purpose in mind. Business practices need to comply with laws and regulations as well as high ethical standards and moral imperatives. Lenovo is committed to our vision to provide smarter technology for all and helping to decarbonize the global economy \\u2013 one of humanity\\u2019s greatest challenges. With that, I am proud to s - hare our environmental, social and governance progress over the past year and our goals for the future. - Lenovo understands that building resiliency and mitigating the effects of climate change are efforts that require collaboration and innovation across businesses and industries. We\\u2019ve established the Lenovo 360 ESG circle with select channel partners to share joint commitments. We also offer a series of sustainable services, such as asset recovery services for products approaching the end of their lifecycle, including data removal, machine refurbishment, and sustainable material reuse. These effo - rts can help our customers achieve sustainability targets while enabling corporate citizenship as a business driver. - 4\\n\\nBuilding an Equitable and Inclusive Society\\n\\nOperating with Integrity, Ethics and Compliance - We believe technology connects people, enables productivity, and creates possibilities. Therefore, it must be inclusive and accessible to all, especially those most in need of it. Last year, we continued to respond to waves of the COVID-19 outbreaks globally. For example, Lenovo\\u2019s charitable arm, the Lenovo Foundation, partnered with nonprofits and disaster relief organizations to help fund and establish the first mobile hospital unit in Bengaluru, India to help battle the pandemic. - Lenovo has made it a priority to comply with laws and regulations and uphold high ethical standards everywhere we do business. Lenovo fully supports the call for the global tech sector to do business fairly, ethically, and transparently. We take security seriously, from product and data security, and from cybersecurity to information privacy. We believe that only with accountability and transparency will we continue to win trust from our customers and stakeholders globally. - In 2021, the Company launched its fifth annual Global Month of Service with participation from employees across 66 countries who collectively contributed over 10,000 volunteer hours to serve their communities. This annual event provided a great opportunity for employees to work closely with local schools and education centers and make a difference in many lives. The Company\\u2019s goal is to impact 15 million people by 2025 through our social partnerships and programs. - A key focus for us is supporting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education to drive positive change. Last year, I made a personal donation of RMB100 million (US$15 million) to help my alma mater, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, build a new facility with a cutting-edge High-Performance Computing (HPC) Center that will improve its computing capabilities and facilitate research and innovation. Over the next three years, Lenovo will sponsor the equivalent of RMB 200 million (US$30 m - illion) to Shanghai Jiao Tong University to support its three-year mission to drive leading scientific research, nurture new talent, and incubate new technologies. - Our ESG efforts have received the highest-ever rating and the best overall industry score for the IT industry from the 2021 Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index, reaching an AA+ rating for the first time. Lenovo has been included in the ranking since 2010, with each consecutive year marking the company\\u2019s ongoing commitment and progress in ESG. - In summary, FY 2021/22 marks another year of Lenovo\\u2019s significant progress and strong external recognition of its environmental, social and governance efforts. Some additional highlights include:\\n\\nFor the third consecutive year, Lenovo was included in Corporate Knights 2022 Global 100 as one of the 100 most sustainable companies in the world.\\n\\nLenovo was included in the highly regarded 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. - Lenovo was selected into the 2022 Gartner Supply Chain Top 25.\\n\\nTo build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive society, I believe we need to start with our workplace. After achieving our three-year target of female executive representation in 2020, we\\u2019ve set the target to increase global female executive representation to 27 percent and executives from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial groups in the U.S. to 35 percent by FY 2025/26. - I\\u2019m pleased to announce a step forward in Lenovo\\u2019s advocacy for women as we commit to the United Nation\\u2019s Women\\u2019s Empowerment Principles to further promote gender equality in our organization, marketplace and communities. This platform for change guides companies to commit to gender equality by investing in and supporting women\\u2019s leadership and decision-making and supports the gender equality dimensions of the 2030 agenda and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. - Lenovo was listed among Fortune magazine\\u2019s World\\u2019s Most Admired Companies, ranking fifth in the broad computing industry.\\n\\nI\\u2019m proud of Lenovo\\u2019s ESG team, comprised of subject matter experts who continue to challenge us with higher goals and drive the company to achieve them. I am confident that despite all uncertainties around the world, Lenovo remains committed to building a smarter, brighter and more sustainable future for all. - Yang Yuanqing Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lenovo Group Limited\\n\\nA similar commitment also applies to serving more than one billion individuals around the world who live with disabilities. Lenovo\\u2019s Product Diversity Office works with inclusive design experts and will review 75 percent of Lenovo products by 2025 to ensure they work for everyone, regardless of physical attributes or abilities. - Our efforts have earned us external recognition. We\\u2019ve won 24 best employer and best workplace awards around the world, including recognitions for gender equality, disability inclusion, and LGBTQ+ Equality.\\n\\n5\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n, - j\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nA Message from our Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer\\n\\nStarting with a Vision - Having a clear and compelling vision helps define a company\\u2019s role in society and guides how it operates, supports issues, and engages with all stakeholders. Vision must be backed by meaningful actions and tangible goals. For Lenovo, our vision to provide smarter technology for all is engrained into all aspects of our business and drives our overall ESG efforts. By centering our company around our vision and aligning our commitments to it, we are reminded to continue working to build a brighter, - more sustainable future for our stakeholders and the planet. - Leading with Credibility - The disruptive toll on our planet is nearing a point of no return and there has never been greater urgency to address climate change. This heightened public concern has provoked many commitments from companies and institutions. Lenovo acknowledges the complexity of a global transition to a low-carbon economy and the amount of collaboration and innovation required. Lenovo supported the development of a standard aligned with the latest climate science and was selected to road test the Science Base - d Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard before it was launched in October 2021. We also performed an initial financial and feasibility study to size the next steps to support a path to net-zero by 2050. - I\\u2019ve witnessed many corporations respond to the unprecedented challenges of the past several years with an accelerated focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. And like many other organizations, we remain steadfast on our ESG journey as we learn to navigate the world and events that challenge even the strongest organizations. - In March 2022, we signed the SBTi Commitment Letter pledging to set net-zero targets, including a long-term science-based target by aligning with 1.5\\u00b0C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5\\u00b0C campaign. To further support SBTI\\u2019s call for corporate action, we also joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Race to Zero campaign, a broad coalition of organizations committing to set science-based targets to help build a prosperous, net-zero carbon economy - by 2050. - During FY 2021/22, Lenovo remained focused on developing innovative solutions that reshaped the way we conduct business around the world and helped to preserve the ecosystems on which our future depends. Despite disruptions, we are transforming risks into opportunities that can support our long-term growth. Even more, we are taking steps to promote a culture from the top-down to ensure ESG considerations are integrated with the business decision-making process. - Global operation comes with a global responsibility\\n\\nBusinesses of all sizes have the opportunity to build ESG commitments into day-to-day operations. However, those with a global footprint have an even greater obligation to use their size and scale as a force for good and influence those within their supply chains across markets. As a global company, we recognize our fundamental responsibilities in the areas\\n\\n6 - of ESG in the markets where we operate as we strive to integrate related values and principles wherever we conduct business. Lenovo\\u2019s Code of Conduct mandates compliance with applicable laws in markets where we conduct business, and our policies strongly support ethical and responsible business practices. - Putting Accountability at the Forefront\\n\\nFor the fifth consecutive year, Lenovo was included in the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation\\u2019s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, and received a score of 100 with the distinction of \\u201cBest Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality\\u201d. The Index is the premier benchmarking survey on corporate policies and practices for LGBTQ workplace equality in the United States. - Developing ESG goals and initiatives that support a resilient way forward can simultaneously create long-term value for stakeholders. An effective way to achieve progress is through a collective dedication to holding ourselves \\u2013 and each other \\u2013 accountable. At Lenovo, we establish internal accountability through the ESG Executive Oversight Committee (EOC), which provides strategic direction and facilitates the coordination of ESG efforts across Lenovo. The ESG EOC is comprised of senior managem - ent from across the business and functional areas and is chartered to promote a culture that encourages strong ESG performance, including compliance and leadership activities. - For the ninth consecutive year, Lenovo received a Gold Award of \\u201cMost Sustainable Companies\\u201d from The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA)\\u2019s 2021 Best Corporate Governance and ESG Awards. - As we look ahead, we will continue to leverage our strengths as we seek opportunities that improve our ESG performance and support our growth. Our genuine endeavors aim to be more than good intentions. Guided by our higher purpose, we will continue our ESG focus and demonstrate resilience by remaining steadfast on the long-term, listening to our stakeholders\\u2019 needs, and supporting our vision to provide smarter technology for all. - Demonstrating Measured Progress in ESG\\n\\nThroughout this ESG Report, we share the progress we\\u2019ve made as well as outline our goals that support our long-term vision. We are proud of what we have accomplished together, despite the many challenges. Once again, we have proven to be a united, dependable organization that rises to the challenge and conquers difficulty. In FY 2021/2022, our ESG activities reached important milestones, and some received external recognitions, including: - John Cerretani Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer Lenovo Group Limited - Lenovo was included in the 2021 CDP A list for water and received an A- for climate. CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) assesses companies on the comprehensiveness of climate and water disclosures, awareness and management of environmental risks, and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets. - September 2021 marked Lenovo\\u2019s fifth annual Love on Global Month of Service, inviting employees in 66 countries around the world to make a positive social impact in their communities. Projects were aligned with Lenovo Foundation\\u2019s mission to empower underrepresented populations with access to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the employee volunteer event grew by participating offices (+52%), number of volunteers (+17%), and number - of beneficiaries (+9%) since 2020. - 7\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nLenovo Group Limited 2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance Report\\n\\n8\\n\\nLenovo Group Limited 2021/22 Environmental, Social and Governance Report - 2.0 About this Report\\n\\n10\\n\\nAbout this Report\\n\\n11\\n\\nMaterial Topics\\n\\n13\\n\\nOrganizational Profile\\n\\n14\\n\\nSupporting the U.N.

Its ESG materiality assessment identifies energy and emissions as material topics that it should prioritize and focus on in its environmental programs. In support of UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 \\u2013 Climate Action, one of the Company\\u2019s ESG pillars includes a climate action goal. More details - about the Company\\u2019s materiality assessment and how its goals align with the SDGs are available on page 14. - The significant risks and opportunities associated with climate change are identified and evaluated as part of two main processes within the Company\\u2019s business management systems. These include its global Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process and its annual environmental significant aspect evaluation. These two processes are connected, meaning that if climate change risks are identified in the global risk registration, they are considered in the environmental aspects\\u2019 analysis \\u2013 and vice vers - a. - 1.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s formal risk management process includes, among other sustainability factors: environmental risk categories such as environmental incidents, catastrophic weather conditions, supply chain disruptions, and other elements. Each major business unit and function is required to identify risks and assess their impacts on the Company\\u2019s strategy execution, then develop mitigation plans for select identified risks. This process is managed by the Company\\u2019s ERM team. - For more information about the Company\\u2019s identification and assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities, metrics, and actions to address climate change, please read the Company\\u2019s responses to the most recent CDP Climate questionnaire.\\n\\nIn 2021, the Company scored an A- \\u201cLeadership Level\\u201d on CDP\\u2019s Climate Change questionnaire which reflects its performance toward environmental stewardship through climate change mitigation practices in its operations and supply chain.\\n\\n23 - E x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nOther Air Emissions - The Company\\u2019s baseline environmental engineering specification prohibits the use of ozone-depleting substances in its products and manufacturing processes except in HVAC and fire-suppression equipment as permitted by law which are managed in accordance with local regulations, and intentional releases are prohibited. The Company\\u2019s EMS requires the release of chemical substances to be reported as an environmental incident, including unintentional releases. During FY 2021/22, there were no reported - incidents of refrigerant releases. The Company\\u2019s operational processes do not have significant (as defined by the Company\\u2019s SEA process) direct air emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM). In addition, the Company has no wet chemical or industrial processes that use volatile organic compounds (VOC) and thus has no point sources of VOC. Household and cleaning products that contain small quantities of VOC are used at some of its facilities but asso - ciated fugitive emissions are minimal and are not quantified. - The Company\\u2019s EMS requires sites to report environmental incidents, including waste-related incidents, through the internal environmental database. During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, no waste-related incidents were reported. In addition to internal reporting, the Company\\u2019s manufacturing facilities periodically undergo audits, some of which cover aspects of waste management. For more information on audits at the Company\\u2019s facilities, see Section 4.0. - The Company recognizes that waste management is important throughout the value chain. The Company requires suppliers to meet the Supplier Code of Conduct and the RBA Code of Conduct through contractual stipulations, both of which include waste-related provisions. The Company uses RBA audits to verify compliance of suppliers that comprise its top 95 percent of spend. For more information on these supplier activities, see Section 6.0. - The Company manages downstream impacts through a product-end-of-life (PELM) program. More information on the Company\\u2019s PELM activities can be found in the corresponding section. - WASTE\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s day-to-day operations around the globe generate nonhazardous waste and minimal quantities of hazardous waste. To ensure waste is properly managed and in an attempt to minimize environmental impact, the Company\\u2019s waste, both nonhazardous and hazardous, are separated and collected on the site of generation and disposed of through third-party waste management companies in accordance with its Site Environmental Programs Manual and applicable legal requirements. - Nonhazardous\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s nonhazardous waste includes typical office and cafeteria waste as well as packaging and manufacturing scrap at manufacturing locations.\\n\\nUnder the Company\\u2019s EMS, a global nonhazardous waste target is set annually. For the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the target was to direct 90 percent (+/-5 percent) of the Company\\u2019s nonhazardous waste to recovery operations. The results of the Company\\u2019s environmental targets are available in Section 8.0. - During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company continued to measure and monitor both nonhazardous and hazardous waste generation volumes and disposal methods through an internal environmental database. In this system, environmental focal points at its sites collect and upload monthly waste data preferably from measured data or calculations based on measured data. When no measured data is available, nonhazardous waste estimations are based on the headcount at the site and the previous year\\u2019s - monthly data from similar sites4. - Hazardous\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is waste designated as hazardous by applicable laws or regulations in a country, state, region, or locality and may include oils, coolants, organic solvents, batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and ballasts. Hazardous waste is required to be disposed of in accordance with local environmental regulations with approved suppliers.\\n\\n4 - In FY 2021/22, three offices did not report waste data due to site specific limitations.\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s waste data for the current reporting period is presented in Section 7.0. Annual Verification Statements for the Company\\u2019s total nonhazardous and hazardous waste are available on the Company\\u2019s website.\\n\\n24\\n\\nWATER\\n\\nThe Company is working both internally and externally to minimize and mitigate water risks. The Company has:\\n\\nImplemented a corporate Water Resiliency Policy; - Endorsed the UN CEO Water Mandate; and\\n\\nPledged alignment with SBTN\\u2019s goals and vision and contributing advice and end-user insights to the development of SBTN methods and tools as an SBTN Corporate Engagement Participant - Over 99 percent of the Company\\u2019s water is supplied by third parties. To date, the Company has not experienced any issues with sourcing water that is fit for purpose. Over 99 percent of the Company\\u2019s water is discharged back to third parties for treatment. The Company\\u2019s EMS requires sites to characterize their discharges before entering into an agreement with a treatment facility (exceptions may exist for typical sanitary waste), to not discharge constituents for which a treatment facility does n - ot have treatment capability, to update characterization when a site\\u2019s activities change, and to adhere, as applicable, to the discharge limits of local law, the treatment facility, and any associated permits. - In addition, in celebration of World Water Day 2022 and to support the importance of increased water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, the Lenovo Foundation announced a global partnership with Wine To Water (W|W), a non-profit organization committed to supporting life and dignity for all through the power of clean water. - The Company\\u2019s EMS includes annual global water targets. For the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the targets were to maintain per person water withdrawal (volumes not to exceed a 5 percent increase compared to the FY 2020/21 reporting period) and perform a water withdrawal and risk analysis of the Company\\u2019s operations. These targets were achieved through maintaining operational control of water withdrawals, local targets at select sites, and analysis of site water withdrawal volumes and local water - risk indicators determined using publicly available tools. The results of the Company\\u2019s environmental targets are available in Section 8.0. - The Company requires sites to report environmental incidents, including water-related incidents, through its internal environmental database. During the FY 2021/22, there was one water-related incident. In 2021, the Company received a violation for a lapse in a sewage discharge permit for a site under construction. As part of this, the Company renewed the permit and paid a fine of approximately US$4,000. In addition to internal reporting, the Company\\u2019s manufacturing facilities undergo periodic a - udits some of which cover aspects of WASH and water management. For more information on audits at the Company\\u2019s facilities, see Section 4.0. - During the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company continued to measure and monitor water use and risk. In the Company\\u2019s direct operations, the primary use of water is for WASH services for employees, contractors and visitors in its facilities around the globe. Because the Company\\u2019s primary water use is employees, water use varies from location to location with its largest manufacturing facilities, the sites with the largest employee headcount, withdrawing and discharging the most water. The Co - mpany\\u2019s water data for the current reporting period is presented in Section 7.0.

The Company will continue its efforts to support full material disclosure. Those who do not provide Full Material Disclosures are requested to ensure their components\\u2019 compliance with its format of mat - erial disclosure, IEC 62474 declaration, test report, or self-declaration. - The Company informs its customers about the environmental attributes of its products and compliance with applicable laws and regulations through an industry-standard IT Eco Declaration form. Declarations for newly released products are posted on the Company\\u2019s ECO Declarations webpage. - The Company continues to incorporate post-industrial recycled content (PIC) plastics, post-consumer recycled content (PCC) plastics, and closed-loop post-consumer recycled plastics (CL PCR) and to introduce new materials such as ocean bound plastics and recycled metals into its products. These recycled materials are instrumental to the Company\\u2019s product development strategy and transition to a circular economy. Using these engineered plastics not only saves the natural resources and energy that - would have gone into manufacturing new plastics but also diverts these materials from landfills. The Company\\u2019s increased use of CL PCR is helping to sustain the demand for plastic materials from IT products. These environmental benefits are achieved while still creating a product that meets the Company\\u2019s high-performance standards. - The Company currently uses post-consumer recycled content in laptops, desktops, workstations, monitors, and accessories and is introducing its closed-loop process in more products each year. In 2021, the Company expanded the use of CL PCR to 248 products, up from 103 products the previous year.\\n\\nBy FY 2025/26, 100% - Consistent with its precautionary approach, the Company continuously analyzes the regulatory environment and considers input from its customers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders in the evaluation of potential health and environmental impacts of its products. The Company weighs these inputs to determine the restricted substances, as well as the substances of interest to be tracked for reporting and consideration of future restrictions. - of PC products will contain post-consumer recycled content materials. 6\\n\\n6 Excludes tablets and accessories - Using PCC in IT products presents significant challenges due to the unique structural, performance, and cosmetic requirements associated with these applications. To overcome the continuing challenges of using recycled content in the design and manufacture of smart connected devices, especially notebooks, tablets, and smartphones, the Company\\u2019s team of engineers works closely with its suppliers to develop and qualify new grades of plastic resins previously unavailable to the IT industry. These ma - terials receive environmental and performance qualifications before their approval and use in their product applications. - 28 - For CL PCR, the Company\\u2019s research and development teams work with material suppliers and a third-party certification authority to build its CL PCR supplier and material process, including the \\u201cApproved Recycling Standard\\u201d, the \\u201cQuality Assurance Operation Requirements\\u201d, and the \\u201cRecovery Ratio\\u201d to validate their sources of waste and control processes using a hierarchical waste product traceability scheme. Since early 2005, the Company\\u2019s cumulative total use of recycled plastics in products has - reached over 123 million kilograms (gross) containing PIC, PCC, and/or CL PCR, with net PCC of over 52 million kilograms and net CL PCR of more than 14 million kilograms. - In addition to recycled plastics mentioned above, during the FY 2021/22 reporting period, the Company began incorporating ocean bound plastics (OBP) and recycled metals in its products. In an effort to reduce ocean pollution, the Company researched and sourced OBP for use in some products. In 2021, the Company introduced OBP content in the speakers of ThinkPad L13 Gen 3 and ThinkPad L13 Yoga Gen 3, and speakers, dummy smart cards, and dummy SIM covers of the ThinkPad L14 Gen 3, and ThinkPad L15 - Gen 3, and C14 Gen 1 Chromebook. - In 2021, the Company\\u2019s use of plastics containing recycled content was approximately 7.8 million kilograms (gross) with a net CL PCR of approximately 4.6 million kilograms. While the Company continues to introduce plastics containing recycled content to more and more products, these usage annual numbers have tended to decrease over time which reflects the Company\\u2019s decreasing use of plastics overall resulting from successful efforts to make products thinner and lighter. - Results of the Company\\u2019s progress against its recycled content usage targets are available in Section 8.0. The Company\\u2019s ESG KPIs include recycled content KPIs, for more information see Section 9.0. - Recycled metal usage also supports the transition to a more circular economy. Recycled metal usage helps reduce mining and consumption of natural resources and has energy and emissions savings. In 2021, the Company introduced 75 percent recycled aluminum for the A/C covers of the ThinkPad Z13 Gen 1 and ThinkPad Z16 Gen 1, and 50 percent recycled aluminum for the A cover of the Yoga 6 Gen 7, and 90 percent recycled magnesium for the A/C covers of the ThinkPad X13s Gen 1. - The Company will begin reporting on the total weight of OBP and recycled metals in the next ESG Report.\\n\\nMilestones for the Company during the past four years in recycled content usage includes:\\n\\n2021\\n\\nExpanded the use of CL PCR to 248 products \\u2022 Introduced Ocean Bound Plastics in \\ufb01ve products \\u2022 Introduced recycled aluminum in three products and magnesium in one product\\n\\n2020 - Expanded the use of CL PCR to 103 products, up from 66 products the previous year \\u2022 Began using CL PCR in a server application for the \\ufb01rst time in the Company\\u2019s ThinkSystem SR950\\n\\n2019\\n\\nExpanded use of CL PCR to 66 additional products \\u2022 1st Use of CL PCR in Lenovo notebook application (X1 Carbon 7th Generation) \\u2022 Desktop and visual models with >25% CL PCR by total product weight\\n\\n2018 - Quali\\ufb01ed new grades of CL PCR for additional resin chemistries and suppliers \\u2022 Expanded use of CL PCR to 21 products (added keyboards)\\n\\n29\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni - In April 2022, the Company was acknowledged as a contributor to a first of a kind research report on plastic pollution, \\u201cPlastic Pollution Prevention and Control in China\\u201d.

The Company\\u2019s supply base is comprised of the following categories: internal manufacturing centers, production procurement, original design manufacturers (ODM), and general procurement. Production procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials or components that become part of the Company\\u2019s products. ODMs include manufacturing partne - rs who manufacture products on behalf of the Company. - General procurement includes all suppliers that provide materials and products which support the Company\\u2019s operations but do not become part of its products. The Company\\u2019s supply base is comprised of multiple tiers in which lower tiers of suppliers provide materials and parts to higher tiers \\u2013 and eventually to its Tier 1 suppliers, the suppliers with whom the Company has a direct contractual relationship. - The disclosures in this report apply to the Company\\u2019s production procurement supplier base. The majority of the Company\\u2019s spend is with production - procurement suppliers which often have ESG impact and risk. Production procurement suppliers can have social risks because they require substantial labor forces and have access to large, lower-skilled labor pools that are vulnerable to exploitation. Production procurement suppliers may generally also have environmental impacts through the energy, water, and materials required for production.\\n\\nDistribution of Suppliers - The Company recognizes there are many benefits in utilizing local suppliers, including decreased logistics costs, potentially lower greenhouse gas emissions, and the opportunity to support local economies and maintain community relationships. The Company considers local suppliers as those that operate in the same country as its significant locations of operations. In FY 2021/22, its significant locations of operations included manufacturing locations in China, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, - Hungary, Japan, and India. The Company estimates that 90 percent of production supply spend in China is with local suppliers. In other manufacturing geographies, the Company estimates that 20 percent of spend is with local suppliers. The chart below shows the geographic distribution of the Company\\u2019s 550 production suppliers in FY 2021/22: - 35 Europe\\n\\n11 India\\n\\n6 Latin America\\n\\n131 North America\\n\\nRegion\\n\\n224 Chinese mainland\\n\\n143 Asia Paci\\ufb01c\\n\\nThe allocation pie chart based on the registered legal entity of the headquarters of suppliers\\n\\n82\\n\\nSupply Chain Process Overview\\n\\nThe most capable suppliers are selected based on the best overall acquisition value - The Company considers the supply chain a vital part of its operations and views effective supply chain management as an important contributor to its success. Given this, the Company has many controls and programs in place to manage its overall procurement process. The Company recognizes that ESG risks and impacts exist among its suppliers which may differ from the ESG impacts and risks associated with the Company\\u2019s own operations. To better manage these risks, the Company has integrated several - ESG-specific controls and practices into its Master Procurement Process. - Key elements of the procurement process include:\\n\\nMaster Procurement Process - The Company\\u2019s Master Procurement Process is designed to oversee all purchase commitments for production materials and the goods and services that support its worldwide operations. With a mission to deliver the best pricing, quality, supply, technology, and service in a sustainable manner, this model provides a controlled procurement approach that is applied across the organization for commodities and includes the following elements for production and general procurement: - Business awards are reviewed and approved with proper delegation of authority\\n\\nNew Supplier Validation - New suppliers are assessed for numerous capabilities including their operational aspects, financial stability, product security, and ESG expectations. More specifically, all new suppliers are reviewed on the Company\\u2019s sustainability policies, codes of conduct, ISO certifications, ESG standards, environmental impact aspects, controls to prevent forced labor, and public reporting. Of particular concern are suppliers that may be listed as restricted or denied parties identified by governments and/o - r international agencies. The Company\\u2019s policy and formal practice is that under no circumstances shall the Company\\u2019s personnel purchase, sell, or ship any product contrary to applicable export laws or to any individual or firm appearing in any relevant government list of any party who has been denied export or import privileges. During FY 2021/22, 78 companies were assessed using this process. - Contract Management\\n\\nDelegation Authority\\n\\nThe Company\\u2019s Code of Conduct includes requirements for the formal delegation which support accountability and responsible procurement practices. The \\u2018Authority to Make Lenovo Commitments\\u2019 section outlines the requirements for delegations with well-defined authority for commitments and other contract terms and conditions and, most importantly, that making business commitments outside these processes is not permitted.\\n\\nSupplier Selection - Supplier relationships are best managed when there are clear stipulations of responsibilities, deliverables, and relevant terms and conditions. The Company\\u2019s supplier contracts incorporate legal and operational agreements and address various types of engagement. Additionally, all production suppliers must comply with the Company\\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct and they are encouraged to comply with the latest version of Responsible Business Alliance\\u2019s (RBA) Code of Conduct. Compliance with the compre - hensive Supplier Code of Conduct is executed via standard purchase agreements or standard purchase orders. The Company\\u2019s Supplier Code of Conduct, as well as the RBA Code of Conduct, strictly prohibit bribery and corruption. The RBA audit protocol includes anti-bribery and anti-corruption in the Ethics section. - Implementing a controlled approach to awarding the Company\\u2019s business to suppliers is critical to meet its procurement objectives and to establish a trusted base of suppliers. Therefore, even the perception of favoritism or bias is unacceptable. To ensure business awards are conducted ethically and fairly, the Company utilizes defined and approved sourcing methods to ensure the following:\\n\\nSuppliers have a fair opportunity to compete for the Company\\u2019s business - Buyers conduct an ethical evaluation on carefully understood facts such as supplier prices, terms, and conditions\\n\\nInternal Training - The Company recognizes that supply chain management is an ever-changing field. To ensure those with delegated authority are informed on current best practices, it conducts numerous communication and education activities throughout the year for its global supply chain team. Typically, the Company conducts monthly events that feature education opportunities with subject matter experts and provides on-demand targeted training. Beginning in FY 2021/22, the Company has enhanced the education program - by releasing additional online training courses, targeting a 100 percent completion rate. - 83\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni - Procurement Process\\n\\nThe Company is committed to sound ESG management across its end-to-end supply chain process. It has ESG-specific systems in place, supported by contractual requirements to help ensure that suppliers meet or exceed applicable labor, environmental, health and safety, and ethics standards. - (direct and through agencies), employee age requirements, timesheets, pay slips, environmental controls, and other documents. The auditors also conduct individual and group interviews with a random selection of employees (direct and through external agencies). During those interviews the auditors, address freedom of association and collective bargaining among other topics by having conversations with the employees regarding their rights at the facility. - The practices below align with its ESG-related internal corporate policies. The Company\\u2019s human rights commitments are codified through its Human Rights Policy and further explained in its Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. The Company\\u2019s environmental commitments are codified in its Environmental Affairs Policy, Climate and Energy Policy and Water Resiliency Policy. The portions of these commitments that apply to its supply chain extend to suppliers through its Supplier Code of Conduc - t. - The table below provides an overview of the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\u2019 annual RBA audit performance. Because suppliers are encouraged to be audited every two years, each year represents approximately one-half of the suppliers in its audit program for the given year (a total of 56 in the previous FY 2020/21).\\n\\nIn the event of supplier non-conformance to ESG requirements, including those identified by RBA audits, several actions may take place, which include:\\n\\nRBA Leadership and VAP Audits - Immediate discontinuation of business for serious violations\\n\\nThe Company started an effort to require its suppliers to commit to achieving RBA Validated Audit Program (VAP) and Factory of Choice (FOC) designations to demonstrate leadership in ESG.\\n\\nTrack audit findings to closure and required supporting evidence whenever possible\\n\\nPenalize the supplier in the quarterly supplier report card score with a sustainability multiplier\\n\\nSenior procurement management engagement with the supplier - Executive Company management engagement with the supplier - This requires significantly high audit scores, formally trained site personnel, and proof of working grievance systems. In FY 2021/22, 87 percent of the Company\\u2019s suppliers by spend achieved VAP Recognition, and almost 6 percent of the spend was designated Factory of Choice (FOC). By comparison, the numbers were 63 percent and 2 percent respectively in FY 2020/21. It is the Company\\u2019s goal that by 2024, 95 percent of its suppliers by spend will have RBA VAP recognition and 50 percent will have FO - C recognition. - In FY 2021/22, 71 RBA VAP audit reports were completed by the Company\\u2019s suppliers. According to the audit report results, none of the Company\\u2019s suppliers had findings related to the use of child labor or forced labor. - Regardless of their self-assessment risk level, the Company requires 95 percent of suppliers by spend to conduct an RBA VAP audit or an equivalent independent, third-party audit by RBA-approved auditors every two years. During these audits, independent auditors stay for several days at the supplier\\u2019s premises to review employee contracts\\n\\n84\\n\\nHistorical Average Scores\\n\\nLabor Score\\n\\nHealth & Safety Score\\n\\nEnvironmental Score\\n\\nEthics Score\\n\\nManagement Score\\n\\nTotal Score\\n\\n# of Priority findings - # of Major findings\\n\\nSuppliers\\n\\n2017\\n\\n153\\n\\n158\\n\\n181\\n\\n191\\n\\n183\\n\\n143\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n6.3\\n\\n2018\\n\\n156\\n\\n167\\n\\n184\\n\\n191\\n\\n188\\n\\n149\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n157\\n\\n174\\n\\n184\\n\\n197\\n\\n187\\n\\n153\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n5.0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n157\\n\\n173\\n\\n189\\n\\n199\\n\\n190\\n\\n155\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n5.4\\n\\n2021\\n\\n158\\n\\n180\\n\\n193\\n\\n198\\n\\n196\\n\\n165\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n4.7\\n\\nODM Partners\\n\\n2019\\n\\n156\\n\\n175\\n\\n182\\n\\n197\\n\\n188\\n\\n156\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n5.6\\n\\n2020\\n\\n166\\n\\n188\\n\\n196\\n\\n200\\n\\n197\\n\\n172\\n\\n0.2\\n\\n3.3\\n\\n2021\\n\\n167\\n\\n181\\n\\n197\\n\\n194\\n\\n194\\n\\n170\\n\\n0.1\\n\\n3.9 - Audit Results and Responses\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, 63 suppliers had major labor findings identified in their audits. The most common supplier audit findings are related to an industry-wide problem of excessive working hours and insufficient time off for their employees. While most of this work is done voluntarily by the employees, the Company considers these findings as significant or potentially negative - social impacts. The Company requires its outsourced manufacturers to report their employees\\u2019 working hours and time off performance monthly via an online tool so that it can take action to resolve any issues that are identified. Because agreements for improvement were reached with suppliers with significant or potentially negative social impacts, no relationships were terminated as a result of the labor findings. The FY 2021/22 results are shown below.\\n\\n14% Conformance\\n\\n14% Major\\n\\n19% Major - Excessive Working Hours\\n\\n67% Minor\\n\\n10% Minor\\n\\nInsufficient Time off\\n\\n76% Conformance\\n\\n85\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl\\n\\ni\\n\\nC o n s o\\n\\nl i\\n\\nd a t e d M e t r i c s\\n\\nE M S P e r f o r m a n c e O b e c t i v e s a n d T a r g e t s\\n\\n,\\n\\nj\\n\\nL o n g T e r m K P\\n\\nI\\n\\nP r o g r e s s\\n\\nA p p e n d x\\n\\ni\\n\\nJoint Audits with Company\\u2019s PCSD Quality Team - Child Labor\\n\\nBesides running the Company\\u2019s formal RBA Program, the Global Supply Chain Team also collaborates with the Company\\u2019s PCs and Smart Devices (PCSD) Quality Team to conduct on-site audits in suppliers\\u2019 facilities. With assistance from the Quality Team, the Company is building a new way to emphasize the importance of monitoring its suppliers. - The new joint program was launched in October 2021. In total, 81 PCSD Quality Engineers have been trained by the Company\\u2019s RBA professionals and have engaged in 80 supplier audits. These audits focus on Labor, Health and Safety. The Company\\u2019s Quality Team leads the audit by using pre-designed questionnaires and checklists developed by the ESG Team in accordance with the RBA standard. - The Company supports universal human rights including those identified in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Company commits to extending these rights to its employees and others directly or indirectly employed in its supply chain. Child labor is not to be used in any stage of business operations. The term \\u201cchild\\u201d refers to any person under the age of 15, under the age for com - pleting compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is the highest. To ensure the human rights noted above, the Company implemented multiple guidelines and actions including, but not limited to: - Human Rights Policy\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nEmployee Code of Conduct\\n\\nForced Labor\\n\\nSupplier Code of Conduct - Source Right 6.1\\n\\nThe Company is committed to eradicating forced labor in all its forms including slavery and human trafficking at every stage of business operations. It holds a firm position that there is zero tolerance for forced labor and any documented instances will be met with immediate action, including discontinuing the business relationship with any suppliers that overlook this practice.\\n\\nDue diligence and audits across the supply chain to identify risks in child labor violations - Mandatory education and certification on labor topics for buyers\\n\\nTo better detect and mitigate the forced labor risks, the Company adopts and implements preventive measures. In FY 2021/22, some of the Company\\u2019s actions to prevent this practice were:\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, there were no violations reported related to child labor at the Company\\u2019s suppliers\\u2019 RBA VAP audits. - Living Wages\\n\\nUpdated version of the Supplier Code of Conduct enhancing the management of labor agents and contractors\\n\\nUpdated version of the Procurement Source Right Code 6.1, improved with new supplier validation process\\n\\nMandatory education and certification on forced labor prevention for a total of 325 sourcing managers from all global business groups - Through the RBA audit and corrective action process, the Company drives suppliers to adhere to applicable wage and benefit laws and regulations. In FY 2021/22, the Company decided to move a step forward to extend the responsibility from the worker\\u2019s individual wellbeing to an employee\\u2019s family. The Company is participating in the RBA Living Wage work group and is exploring the development of implementation guidelines to support workers throughout the supply chain. The ultimate target of the Livi - ng Wage project team is to publish a Living Wage policy, to deliver training, and verify the baseline within its business in 2022. - A third-party ESG risk assessment tool (EcoVadis) launched to screen suppliers throughout the supply chain tiers\\n\\nQuarterly discussions with suppliers on potential red flags related to forced labor\\n\\nRegular RBA Responsible Labor Initiative/VAP workgroup engagements\\n\\n86\\n\\nEcoVadis - Responsible Sourcing of Materials\\n\\nThe Company is continuously increasing focus on sustainability in procurement. In FY 2021/22, it began to strategically expand the scope of ESG assessments to suppliers across all categories by launching the EcoVadis tools. - The EcoVadis platform aims to provide ESG ratings for a large base of suppliers, including production procurement, general procurement, and other key suppliers. The Company has implemented the EcoVadis IQ tool to screen suppliers\\u2019 ESG risk, based on their inherent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) risks and procurement information. In FY 2021/22, more than 457 suppliers were processed in the EcoVadis IQ tool, and 110 suppliers were invited to conduct an EcoVadis ESG assessment. - The Company recognizes the importance of the responsible procurement of raw materials when sourced from regions experiencing political and social conflict, which may include the conflict minerals of tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or surrounding countries. Since 2012, the Company has adhered to the following efforts and expects its production procurement and ODM suppliers to do the same: - The Company continues to ensure that all strategically important suppliers participate in the EcoVadis program and achieve at least 45 of 100 points or a comparable audit result. Suppliers scoring less than 45 out of 100 points must implement a corrective action plan (CAP) and the progress will be tracked within 90 days. - The 360 Watch feature of the EcoVadis platform is another monitoring measure taken to minimize the risk of child and forced labor, or any other social, environmental, and governance risks. Negative media coverage in these areas related to a supplier will be highlighted to the Company\\u2019s management, requiring the supplier to respond within one week, and develop a corrective action plan. The 360 Watch, in addition to other indicators, enables the Company to monitor and score its suppliers on variou - s ESG focus areas, helping it to continually improve the supply base. - The intentions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \\u2018Dodd-Frank 1502 Rule\\u2019 even if not directly regulated by the U.S. SEC\\n\\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Sourcing Materials from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas\\n\\nRBA Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) program - The Company supports the efforts of the RMI to address materials beyond 3TG. In FY 2021/22, the Company conducted extensive due diligence for the Company\\u2019s cobalt supply chain using the Cobalt Reporting Template (CRT) and the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The Company will coordinate with the RMI as RMI performs risk profiles on other materials, assess the content in its products, and further develop due diligence efforts to mitigate supply chain risk. These efforts were init - iated through RMI\\u2019s coordination with the \\u2018Drive Sustainability\\u2019 organization which has already developed risk profiles on over 30 materials in the technology and automotive industry.

These disclosures pertain to production procurement and ODM suppliers. - and requires both RBA priority and major findings to be tracked to closure. None of the RBA audits for the reporting period contained priority environmental findings; therefore, the Company did not terminate any supplier relationships in response to significant potential or actual negative environmental impacts.\\n\\nEnvironmental Impacts in the Supply Chain - The Company\\u2019s corporate-wide environmental standards and specifications require its product designers to consider environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate and encourage recycling and minimization of resource consumption. The Company\\u2019s priority is for its suppliers to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. Compliance to the standards and specifications is monitored as part of the Product Compliance Review Board Process. - Annually, the Company requests key suppliers to formally report environmental data related to climate change, water and waste. The Company asks that suppliers report via the Responsible Business Alliance or the CDP reporting methodologies in addition to responding to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE). Last year, the Company introduced the IPE tool to its suppliers. IPE provides a free tool to help Tier 1 suppliers assess environmental compliance in their supply chain, exten - ding the Company\\u2019s governance to up-stream suppliers. - Environmental Audit Results and Responses\\n\\nDuring the FY 2021/22 reporting period, 71 of the Company\\u2019s suppliers, representing over 50 percent of its total procurement spend, underwent RBA facility-level audits. Over the period of FY 2020/21 and FY 2021/22, 129 suppliers underwent RBA facility-level audits, which represent 95% of the suppliers by spend. The Company considers RBA priority findings to be indicative of significant impacts\\n\\nESG KPI: By FY 2025/26, we will remove\\n\\n1 million - metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from our supply chain*\\n\\nRelative to FY 2018/19 measured emissions\\n\\n88\\n\\nRecognitions - The Company has once again been named in the Gartner Global Supply Chain Top 25 listing for 2022.

The Company\\u2019s target in this area is to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 25 percent per million US$ procurement spend by FY 2029/30, compared to FY 2018/19. Based on FY 2021/22 data, the Company is on track reducing the GHG emissions from purchased goods and services. - In FY 2021/22, the Company\\u2019s procurement team began adding an ESG standard template into its quarterly business review (QBR) with suppliers to maintain ESG as a topic of discussion\\n\\nWater\\n\\nThe Company surveys key suppliers on water-related data including performance indicators such as annual water withdrawal, water discharge, and water recycle/ reuse volumes.\\n\\nScope 3 GHG Emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (MT/per million US$ procurement spend) - Baseline (FY 2018/19)\\n\\nFY 2021/22\\n\\nTarget (FY 2029/30)\\n\\n79\\n\\n73\\n\\n59 - For the most recent supplier data collection period, the Company\\u2019s coverage of engagement was 92 percent of procurement spend. Since one of the most straightforward indicators of impact (especially to water-stressed areas) is water withdrawal, the Company has been encouraging suppliers to set up water reduction targets since 2014. During the last data collection period, 76 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with quantified water reduction goals. - Science Based Targets for Suppliers\\n\\nIn addition to setting Science Based Targets (SBT\\u2019s), the Company has been working to promote the concept of a low carbon transition with production procurement and ODM suppliers. The Company is engaging and incentivizing these suppliers to also commit to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). - Waste\\n\\nThe waste-related information collected from suppliers includes data such as annual hazardous and nonhazardous waste volumes.\\n\\nDuring the reporting period, 28 percent of its procurement spend included suppliers with formally recognized SBT\\u2019s which was an increase of 4 percent from the previous year. It is the Company\\u2019s goal to achieve 95 percent of procurement spend with suppliers that implement SBT\\u2019s. - Waste prevention is the most preferable option in the waste management hierarchy, and the Company encourages suppliers to set up public waste reduction targets. During the last data collection period, 83 percent of procurement spend was with suppliers with quantified waste reduction goals.\\n\\nSUPPLY CHAIN DIVERSITY - Capability Building\\n\\nMany of the Company\\u2019s suppliers are large national and international suppliers. They manage their corporate ESG programs while engaging directly with the Company\\u2019s programs. In addition to its own training programs, the Company offers and provides the following: - The Company\\u2019s Supplier Diversity Program is committed to seeking and developing diverse businesses while contributing to the economic success of communities it serves. It recognizes that supplier diversity creates a win-win by influencing the inclusion of diverse businesses within its supply base which impacts brand reputation management and improves revenue performance through sales.\\n\\n90 - In FY 2021/22, the Company\\u2019s total U.S. spend across all business units with small and/or diverse suppliers accounted for 23 percent of its total expenditure in the U.S.\\n\\nIn FY 2021/22, the Company also exceeded the U.S. Government Small Business Subcontract Plan target of 12 percent by achieving 16 percent of U.S. spend with small businesses over the course of the Fiscal Year. - The Company continues to partner with several non-government organizations (NGO) such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and the Women\\u2019s Business Enterprise Networking Council (WBENC). The Company also increased support to minority businesses through the \\u201cEvolve Small\\u201d program, in collaboration with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and Toronto Regional Board of Trade. Through this initiative, the Company helped small businesses recover from the impact of CO - VID-19 by providing sixty companies in seven different markets across the United States and Canada ongoing support throughout the year. - The GSC Risk Council established a monthly collaborative platform to engage the business unit functions, leverage insight and identify synergies as the Company addresses risk management decisions. The convergence of business function leaders provides the opportunity to evaluate the impacts on the other functions and develop a consolidated business continuity plan with clear actions. - Effective risk management strategies have been a critical part of driving business performance. The Company has also recognized opportunities are created when it transforms risks into opportunities that can support its long-term growth. The Risk Council recently directed a scenario planning exercise that included identifying potential risks from the following categories:\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 - Strategy Financial Catastrophic events Human Capital Legal and Regulatory Compliance Operations Sociopolitical\\n\\nAs the Company moves forward, its success not only lies within workforce diversity but also in the inclusion of diverse suppliers that provide competitive advantages, increased innovation, and revenue that can support its brand reputation.\\n\\nBuilding Supply Chain Resilience - In 2021, the Company established the GSC Risk Council to support risk management throughout its supply chain. The GSC Risk Council\\u2019s mission is to boost the Company\\u2019s growth by implementing risk controls through industry-proven processes that can enable the supply chain to quickly adapt to demands for new technology and reduce the risk associated with the transition. Agility and resilience are critical components for a successful GSC strategy than can withstand the short lifecycle of information - and communications technology products and changing consumer demands. - After analyzing these categories, the strategy team selected the top five risks for the fiscal year. With consideration of the organization\\u2019s risk appetite and the business-driven data that was collected, the team selected the top five potential risks and conducted a comprehensive scenario planning for each risk. For each scenario, the team incorporated stakeholder feedback, identified contributing factors, and analyzed both short-term and long-term impacts. - The information derived from this planning exercise enabled the GSC Risk Council to understand the types of risks that may impact the Company and how those conditions may affect its performance, thus contributing to the development of greater strategy resilience and flexibility throughout the supply chain.\\n\\nThe GSC Risk Council\\u2019s main objectives include the oversight of:\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 -

Data excludes:\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nConsultants and vendors working through a contract agency or third-party performing services or consulting on site for a brief time and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n\\u2013 - Contractors who usually perform non-critical, non-core jobs and their employment decisions, including pay and benefits, are made by the third-party employer \\u2013 and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n\\u2013\\n\\nSupplemental students who are interns or who are hired for a very short window of time and hence excluded from our scope.\\n\\n4 - Turnover rate data covers voluntary departure of regular employees for the full FY 2021/22. Involuntary turnover is planned exit of employees which is in alignment with the company strategy and decisions. Hence, as a strategic and standard practice, this is excluded from reporting.\\n\\n5\\n\\nIn FY 2020/21, turnover rates by region were transposed among AP, China and EMEA. Totals did not change but were realigned with the corresponding region.\\n\\n6 - Metrics based on FY beginning with FY 2018/19. Results were not revised.\\n\\n7\\n\\nLenovo\\u2019s total contributions in responding to natural disasters is US$8,128,720.76. This amount is tracked at the geo level. In prior reporting periods, the Company reported a separate line item for global disaster response. Beginning with FY 2021/22, the disaster response total will be integrated into the respective geographic contributions.\\n\\n8 - Increase in China giving reflects tracking of Lenovo Foundation Beijing and a US$7.8M donation in response to the Henan floods.\\n\\n9\\n\\nTotal giving in Latin America reflects tracking of the Motorola Brazil tax incentive program.\\n\\n10\\n\\nTotal contribution in Asia Pacific includes Lenovo\\u2019s commitment to the India Companies Act.\\n\\n11\\n\\nEstimated value of employee volunteer hours is calculated based off an entry level hourly wage of US$43 per hour.\\n\\n12 - Employee giving represents the corporate match from Lenovo for employees around the world, which increased in FY 2021/22 with the launch of the new Benevity platform.\\n\\n13\\n\\nTotal contribution to communities for FY 2019/20 and FY 2020/21 was defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations. In FY 2021/22 it is defined as the sum of corporate cash and product donations together with Lenovo's match of global employee donations.\\n\\n14 - Product transportation emissions include key upstream suppliers representing majority of global logistics spend. Note: Upon looking into GHG Protocol standard, we decided to re-categorize this to upstream from downstream transportation (from FY 2016/17, previous years were adjusted accordingly).\\n\\n15 - The Company is in the process of improving input data for this Scope 3 category. The data reported here is the best available estimate at the time of publication. In the FY 2022/23 ESG Report, data will be restated if needed to reflect any improved input data.\\n\\n16\\n\\nEmissions from waste include nonhazardous waste, hazardous waste and wastewater from all manufacturing, R&D locations and some large offices. No product waste is included.\\n\\n17 - Purchased goods and services include suppliers covering 94% of direct global suppliers spend. The RBA Carbon and Water Reporting Tool was used for collection of supplier data. Individual supplier data is from each supplier\\u2019s most recent reporting period and not reflective of Lenovo\\u2019s FY 2021/22. Data was allocated based on revenue.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe value for FY 2018/19 is being restated to correct an error that appeared in the FY 2020/21 ESG Report.\\n\\n19 - Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) include transmission & distribution (T&D) losses from Lenovo\\u2019s worldwide purchased electricity and natural gas. A World Bank database and Energy Star Performance Rating document were used for determining T&D loss rates.\\n\\n20 - Lenovo used the current Product Attribute Impact Algorithm (PAIA) notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server tool for calculating emissions of Lenovo\\u2019s typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server. The calculated results show emissions distribution by different parts and also for use, packaging, transportation, and end-of-life treatment categories. The emissions associated with use and end-of-life treatment of sold products were estim - ated on a \\u201cnarrow\\u201d baseline for the typical notebook, desktop, monitor, tablet, all-in-one, thin client and server multiplied by sold/shipped product volumes. - 21\\n\\nEmissions from capital goods are based on purchased capital goods in a given year. The 2012 Guidelines to Defra GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting, Annex 13 was used for emission factors for different type of capital goods adjusted for inflation rate and exchange rate.\\n\\n108\\n\\n22\\n\\nApproximately less than 1% of purchased energy (electricity) is estimated based upon energy use at similar Lenovo facilities with metered usage.\\n\\n23 - When totals are slightly different than the exact sum of individual numbers it is due to rounding.\\n\\n24\\n\\nBrazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, Mexico, United States, Chinese mainland, Taiwan, China represent manufacturing and R&D sites in these markets. \\u201cRest of World\\u201d represents all sites managed by Lenovo\\u2019s Real Estate organization (non-manufacturing) across the world (small and large \\u2014 except the ones in regions listed above).\\n\\n25 - Renewable energy generation capacity includes electric solar panels in Hefei and Wuhan, China and Morrisville and Whitsett, NC, USA and Ullo, Hungary.\\n\\n26 - For FY 2021/22, All Areas includes all the Company\\u2019s manufacturing, research & development, and large office sites (>100 employees). In earlier FYs, some research and development and large office locations were excluded while the Company worked to increase data coverage. Small offices (<100 employees) and retail locations are always excluded from the water reporting requirements, but a few small offices voluntarily report and are included.\\n\\n27 - All water withdrawals are estimated to be freshwater withdrawals. Due to our reliance on third-parties for the vast majority of the Company\\u2019s water withdrawals, it is not possible to determine the exact parameters of all sources, but it is reasonable to assume the majority of the sources had low TDS based on local knowledge and communication with third-parties.\\n\\n28 - Areas with water stress are areas with high or extremely high baseline water stress according to World Resources Institute\\u2019s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Values reported for areas with water stress are a subset of values reported for all areas.\\n\\n29 - Third-party withdrawal by source was collected for all the Company\\u2019s environmentally significant sites (which are the Company\\u2019s ISO14001 certified locations). In FY 2021/22, these locations comprised approximately 82% of the Company\\u2019s withdrawal from water stressed areas. The remaining 18% are primarily from office locations that often require less water and operate as part of a larger office complex where they may not be directly billed by the third-party responsible for withdrawals.\\n\\n30 - For more information on the wastewater exceedance that occurred in FY 2021/22, see page 25.\\n\\n31\\n\\nWater intensity metrics are based on the Company\\u2019s total global headcount which includes the headcount of the excluded locations mentioned in Note 26.\\n\\n32\\n\\nWaste data includes site waste from most manufacturing, processes and operations, research & development sites, and large offices. Waste from products is reported separately.\\n\\n33 - E-waste generated at the Company\\u2019s sites is also included in PELM data.\\n\\n34\\n\\nBatteries collected at Lenovo\\u2019s sites are also included in the PELM data.\\n\\n35\\n\\nThe Company does not operate any onsite recovery operations; all wastes are seperated onsite to be collected by third-parties for recovery offsite.\\n\\n36\\n\\nRecycling includes some composting of nonhazardous, organic wastes.\\n\\n37\\n\\nAll hazardous waste diverted for recovery was diverted for recycling.\\n\\n38 - The Company does not operate any onsite disposal operations; all wastes are seperated onsite to be collected by third-parties for disposal offsite.\\n\\n39 - Lenovo\\u2019s Product End-of-Life Management (PELM) and Product Take Back (PTB) includes materials from customers and Lenovo-owned country returns, manufacturing and R&D scrap, and employee equipment from real estate sites. These metrics represent all data received from PELM suppliers as of the time of publication of this report. Not all data was available at the time of publication, so actual volumes may be higher.\\n\\n40 - These metrics represent all data received from recycled plastics suppliers at the time of publication.\\n\\n41\\n\\nThe CY2021 decrease in percent of notebooks can be attributed to an expanded line of gaming system notebooks that either could not meet the Energy Star requirements or Lenovo decided not to register.\\n\\n42\\n\\nThe CY2021 decrease in percent of monitors was associated with an expanded line of low cost, entry-level consumer displays.\\n\\n43 - Estimated using the average packaging weight per unit and total shipping volumes for the following categories of products: notebooks, desktops, servers, workstations, monitors, smartphones, tablets, and accessories.\\n\\n44\\n\\nThe value for FY 2020/21 is being restated to reflect improved shipping volumes for accessories.\\n\\n109\\n\\nE x e c u t i v e L e t t e r s\\n\\nA b o u t\\n\\nt h i s R e p o r t\\n\\nE n v i r o n m e n t a\\n\\nl\\n\\nS o c a\\n\\ni\\n\\nl\\n\\nG o v e r n a n c e\\n\\nG o b a\\n\\nl\\n\\nl\\n\\nS u p p y C h a n\\n\\nl -

Nonetheless, emissions and its effects on the globe\\u2019s temperature and air quality are multi-generational challenges that our society must and will continue to address in the long term. - One of the key drivers in\\n\\nestablishing Dynagas was to become part of and develop with the LNG transportation industry in order to contribute to lowering global emissions. Natural gas, when combusted, is the lowest emitting fossil fuel. Compared to oil, the combustion of natural gas reduces CO2 emissions by 25% and reduces 95% of NOX emissions, while nearly 100% of SOx and particulars emissions are eliminated. - We believe that natural gas is one of the few available, scalable, environmentally and financially sustainable contributors to lower global emissions today and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The efficiency, flexibility and responsiveness of the combined cycle gas powerplant makes natural gas a very important baseload provider of energy that can be complemented with renewable providers such as wind and solar, whose output is variable and dependent on factors beyond human control. - We consider it noteworthy to mention that up to the moment of the energy crisis, there was a desire by policy makers to drive up fossil fuel prices (through emission taxes, reduction of new investments in fossil fuel projects etc) in order to curb fossil demand. Today, after a period of protracted under-investment in oil and gas infrastructure, high energy prices are sending the global economy into recession. Following recent events, we can conclude that our society is not yet equipped to depart - from an available and on demand energy infrastructure primarily based on fossil fuels as - long as a workable alternative is not in place. Clearly, the change into renewable technologies is a long transition and not a switch, which will require significant technological developments, careful implementation, creative solutions and an approach that prioritizes prosperity and justice. The recent turmoil in the global energy markets has been an important reminder of this inescapable fact. - In order to make a difference to the environment, the key is to develop and improve as an industry. The shipping industry and in particular the LNG shipping industry has in fact improved its carbon footprint per unit transported dramatically during the last 15 years. The main reasons for these improvements are new developments in technology in terms of cargo containment systems, re-liquefaction systems, communications, weather routing systems, and of course propulsion systems. Even in the absenc - e of any regulatory requirements the LNG shipping and equipment industry have been responsible by continuing to develop new technological solutions. - Apart from a desire to improve the vessels emissions profile, shipowners are incentivised to contribute to continuous improvement and reduction of emissions because a reduction in fuel consumption (which yields emissions savings) also reduces the cost per unit transported and improves the vessel\\u2019s financial performance.\\n\\nThe LNG shipping industry and Dynagas have and will continue to innovate and remain focused on - lowering emissions in a sustainable manner as the path towards decarbonization becomes clearer. We recognize the importance of climate change and the need to develop sustainable solutions and we are committed in embedding the ESG factor in our business model. - Our main target in compiling this ESG report is to meet the expectations of our stakeholders considering the impact they have to our business. We are committed to operate in a socially responsible manner ensuring the safety of our people and the environment, through a transparent and an ethical behaviour. The social and governance component of ESG is of paramount importance for us, as social purpose-led goals are woven into our company\\u2019s culture. The health, well-being and development of our cre - w and employees remains our top priority as we continue to build on an already successful track record. - Despite the continuous innovation and considerable selection of modern and fuel-efficient propulsion systems, the 2050 IMO global strategy and objective brings us to the need to work with the industry to find ways of continuing to reduce the environmental footprint. - The effective management of Environmental, Social and Governance matters are fundamental and of key strategic importance to Dynagas LNG Partners LP, as we work together to develop long term sustainable practices and create value to our shareholders, business, our employees, customers, investors and the community.\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n1.

SUSTAINABILITY AT DYNAGAS - The LNG Supply Chain\\n\\nLNG is transported through sea in purpose-built tanks on double-hulled ships to a receiving terminal, where it is unloaded and stored in heavily insulated tanks. The LNG is then returned to its gaseous state, or regasified, in regasification facilities at the receiving terminal. Finally, the regasified LNG is moved through pipeline for distribution to natural gas customers.\\n\\nLNG\\n\\n3.

ENVIRONMENT: CLIMATE IMPACT AND EMISSIONS\\n\\nStrict environmental regulations put further pressure on the shipping industry towards decarbonization.\\n\\n2018 - The International Maritime Organization (IMO), adopted an initial strategy for the reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping, targeting to reduce the total annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050 and the CO2 emissions per transport work, as an average across international shipping, by at least 40% by 2030, pursuing efforts towards a reduction of 70% by 2050 (in comparison to 2008 levels).\\n\\n2019 - The European Commission published the Green Deal, which is a package of policy initiatives, to assist EU on the path to a green transition, with the aim of reaching climate neutrality by 2050 including a target to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050 over the baseline level of the year 1990.\\n\\n2020 - The IMO adopted amendments to the MARPOL convention that require ships to combine technical - Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) - and operational - Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) - measures to reduce their carbon intensity gradually by 2% annually from 2023 through 2026. - The European Commission published \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d package, targeting a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The \\u201cFit for 55\\u201d includes four proposals which are directly related to the shipping industry, more specifically to the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the set of a maximum limit on the GHG intensity of energy used on board by a ship (FuelEU Maritime Initiative), the introduction of a minimum tax rate on the relevant fuels used for intra-EU ferr - y, fishing and freight vessels (Energy Taxation Directive) and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation to ensure that the decarbonization pathway of the transport fleet is supported by adequate recharging and refueling infrastructure in EU ports. - LNG is considered to be the cleanest fossil fuel and a \\u201cbridge fuel\\u201d in the context of the energy transition. Global shipping is turning towards the selection of LNG as a fuel towards decarbonization. The combustion of LNG fuel emits lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than coal or oil, as well as lower nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and almost no environmentally-damaging Sulphur Oxides (SOx) emissions.\\n\\nWe are committed to meet industry\\u2019s targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.\\n\\n18 - 19\\n\\n5.

In order to comply with the said regulation vessels should: (i) use 0.5% sulphur fuels on board, (ii) instal scrubbers (Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems - ESGSs) for cleaning of the exhaust gases of the vessels, and (iii) retrofit vessels to be powered by liquefied natural gas. Entry into force: January 1, 2020. - Our response\\n\\nThe use of LNG as fuel is promoted as one of the most effective compliance means. All of our vessels can operate with low-sulphur fuels.\\n\\nInventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM)\\n\\nZERO\\n\\nnon-compliance with environmental laws and regulations incidents in 2021 - Regulation aiming to ensure that ships, being recycled once they reach the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risks to the environment, human health and safety Vessels of 500 gross tonnage or above, regardless of flag, will require a certified IHM on board if calling at an EU port or anchorage. Non-EU flagged vessels may also be certified against EU SRR by complying with the HKC IHM requirements. Entered into force: December 31, 2020. - Our response\\n\\nAll of our vessels hold an approved IHM certificate and Statement of Compliance. Relevant training is offered ashore and onboard.\\n\\nIEnergy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) - Amendments to MARPOL Convention introduced requirements to assess and measure the energy efficiency of all ships and set the required attainment values, with the goal of reducing the carbon intensity of international shipping. The requirements include a technical approach to reduce carbon intensity based on the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) which measures the theoretical energy efficiency of ships. The attained EEXI is required to be calculated for ships of 400 gross tonnage and a - bove.

Reciprocally, to reduce the production of waste on board the ship on all voyages, it is required the packaging of all supplied stores, provisions and spares to be environmentally friendly, recyclable and to be kept to a safe minimum. - Since 2001, the IMO has adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, or the \\u201cAnti-fouling Convention\\u201d. The Convention entered into force on September 17, 2008 and prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of molluscs and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. - The supply of stores in bulk (i.e. lub oils) further reduces the number of drums, wastes, etc., in this respect all relevant departments pass relevant instructions to suppliers and Master and report their responses.\\n\\nWe have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti- fouling Convention. - The waste quantities produced in 2021 by each of our LNG carriers (on board) per month in presented in the Table below.

Describe your business model (including business object, products/services) . WUQM Consulting GmbH is a management consultancy based in W\\u00fcrzburg, Germany. Since 1994, we have been advising and supporting companies and organizations in the implementation, monitoring and verification, maintenance and continuous further development of process-oriented (integrated) management systems or operational processes (measurement, monitoring and audit activities) in particular in the following areas: You can find more details on our consulting topics and services here. In addition, we offer a wide range of training courses, specialist seminars and thematic in-house training to strengthen legal certainty in companies and to develop professional competencies. . Occupational Safety and Health Protection; Data Protection and Information Security; Energy Management, Energy and Resource Efficiency; Sustainability Management, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Quality Management; Food Safety; Risk Management and Product Safety; Environmental Management and EMASeasyTM Methodology . Additional remarks: . WUQM Consulting not only offers its customers the opportunity to take a role model on the way to a more sustainable business way by supporting them, for example, in the introduction of integrated management systems, but also sets a good example. As a micro-enterprise, WUQM is not obliged to report on its sustainability commitment in the sense of the CSR Directive Implementation Act, but takes sustainability reporting as an opportunity and voluntarily reports. In 2015, WUQM Consulting introduced the integrated management system EMASplus. In autumn 2015, an external expert confirmed the standard conformity of WUQM Consulting with the EMAS Regulation and EMASplus. The registration certificate was handed over to the company by the IHK W\\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt in spring 2016. WUQM Consulting's commitment to sustainability also includes the signing of the sustainability code of the event industry, which is a fair obligation for the organisation of its own events and seminars. Since 2017, WUQM Consulting has also been an official DNK training partner and contributes to the German sustainability code's promotion of sustainable business through the provision of information events and training courses. For more details, please refer to our sustainability report with an integrated 2015 environmental statement and our updated 2017 environmental statement. . 1. Strategic analysis and measures . The company discloses whether it pursues a sustainability strategy and explains what concrete measures it is taking to operate in accordance with the essential and recognised industry-specific, national and international standards. . In 2015, WUQM Consulting applied the process-oriented methodology Ecomapping\\u00ae and EMASeasyTM and introduced the integrated sustainability management system EMASplus to meet the standards of the EMAS Regulation, the EMASplus Directive, ISO 14001 and ISO 26000. Important elements of this methodology are the analysis of the essential social, environmental and economic aspects of business practices, their opportunities and risks, as well as the development of a program with defined measures, responsibilities and objectives based on an FLIPO matrix with integrated sustainability assessment of the individual activities of the company. To complement the FLIPO matrix, WUQM Consulting's team also carried out a SWOT analysis, which identifies strengths and weaknesses for the company's future viability. Derivation of appropriate measures is currently in progress. A more detailed description of the methodology and the individual analysis steps can be found in the Sustainability Report with an integrated Environmental Statement 2015 and in the updated Environmental Statement 2017. . 2. Materiality . The company discloses which aspects of its own business activities have a significant impact on aspects of sustainability and the significant impact the aspects of sustainability have on its business activities. It analyses the positive and negative effects and indicates how these findings are incorporated into its own processes. . WUQM Consulting sees itself as a pioneer for sustainable business \\u2013 on the one hand through its advisory services to companies and organizations, and on the other hand through its assumption of responsibility for the social impact of its own business activities. Therefore, a key sustainability aspect is the consistent alignment of decisions with the corporate guidelines and the definition of concrete annual targets. The latter are stated in the 2016-2018 improvement programme (see updated Environmental Statement 2017, pp. 9-14). The improvement programme lists the measures implemented and planned for the sustainability aspects identified as relevant in the FLIPO matrix: 1) Positioning of WUQM Consulting as a pioneer and model for other companies and organisations 2) Promoting employee motivation and satisfaction 3) Promoting customer satisfaction 4) Environmentally friendly design of events 5) Establishment of an environmentally friendly mobility behaviour 6) Establishment of an environmentally friendly and fair procurement 7) Promotion of employee health 8) Establishment of transparent and environmentally friendly waste management In accordance with the company guidelines, WUQM Consulting strives to promote environmentally friendly and socially appropriate action in order to strengthen the sustainability of companies and organizations. In order to implement this claim in its own company, WUQM Consulting always takes into account its impact on the environment and society in its decisions and business practices. The company supports sustainable value creation in the region by preferably cooperating with local suppliers, service providers and organizations. By exchanging and actively engaging in regional, nationwide and international projects, networks and cooperations, the existing competencies are optimally introduced and expanded. This principle also applies to its own employees, whose motivation and satisfaction is increased, for example, by the targeted promotion of their strengths. The basis for this is a cooperation based on honesty and trust. . Objectives . The company discloses which qualitative and/or quantitative as well as time-defined sustainability goals are set and operationalized and how their level of achievement is controlled. . WUQM Consulting has defined goals in its 2016-2018 improvement programme (see updated Environmental Statement 2017, pp. 9-14) as part of the EMASplus integrated management system for each sustainability aspect and assigned them to achieve targets. An annual update is carried out, which guarantees a continuous optimization process involving all employees. The monitoring is carried out by the sustainability officers (internal audits, continuation of improvement program, team meetings, reporting) and the management (management review). Environmental indicators for reviewing the achievement of targets are analysed in an input-output analysis ( Electricity and heat, mobility, material consumption, energy consumption, water and wastewater, waste, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants) were recorded. By means of an environmental verifier (external audit), WUQM Consulting was officially confirmed by the EMAS Regulation (integrated into ISO 14001) and the EMASplus Directive (integrated into ISO 26000) at the end of 2015 and the corresponding certificates or certificates were handed over by the IHK W\\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt. Details on the quantitative and qualitative objectives, the state of implementation of the measures as well as the input-output analysis can be read in the Sustainability Report with integrated environmental declaration 2015 and in the updated environmental declaration 2017. . 4. Depth of the value chain . The company specifies the importance of sustainability aspects for value creation and to what depth of its value chain sustainability criteria are reviewed. . WUQM Consulting provides its value creation mainly in consulting or through training courses in the areas of energy, environmental and sustainability management as well as occupational and health protection. The company offers customers throughout Germany, but primarily within a radius of 200km from its own location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The resulting frequent travel activities have a high environmental relevance. To minimize the negative environmental impacts through mobility, the preferred means of transport is the railway. The employees are provided with the BahnCard 50 for this purpose. If it is not possible to travel by train, reasonable carpoolings will be formed. Two e-charging stations were installed on the company's parking spaces and a plug-in hybrid vehicle leased for the management in December 2016. Furthermore, the possibility of leasing e-bikes, the reimbursement of costs for public transport and the development of a business travel policy is planned for 2017. Another important point for the added value of WUQM Consulting is the provision of information and training events. By moving to new office rooms on the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areal (the buildings under the protection of monuments have been built according to current EnEV- Since autumn 2015, WUQM Consulting has been providing its own seminar room. The events are conducted in accordance with the sustainability code in a fair manner. Most of the materials are digitally made available to participants on USB stick to save resources. If this is not possible, WUQM Consulting will only use recycled paper (Blauer Engel) to print the materials. In addition, an expansion of the event portfolio to include digital offers is planned for the future. For internal office supplies, a procurement policy sets environmentally friendly and fair standards for the purchase of office equipment, IT-based equipment and equipment. Equipment and food pre-orders are ordered almost exclusively from environmentally certified partners (shippers, printing companies, etc.). WUQM Consulting is very strongly involved in regional networks for the exchange of experience, the establishment of best practice examples and the use of synergy effects to promote the regional business location Mainfranken (supporting the environment Unterfranken e.V., advisory network Mainfranken, model Hohenlohe, BVMW Mainfranken, energy efficiency initiative Unterfranken, etc.). . 5. Responsibility . The responsibilities in corporate management for sustainability are disclosed. . The overall responsibility for the management system lies with the management board, Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig and Dr. Michael Zoller. The sustainability officer, Tina Heinemann, was qualified and appointed for the introduction, maintenance and further development of the integrated management system. The managing director Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig is a specialist for occupational safety (SiFa) and is responsible for risk assessments, instruction, ergonomics at the workplace and all questions relating to occupational and health protection in the office and field service. The second managing director Dr. Michael Zoller is responsible for the implementation of internal data protection. Legally, WUQM Consutling is not obliged to appoint a data protection officer, but the company benefits from these additional qualifications. . 6. Rules and processes . The company discloses how the sustainability strategy is implemented through rules and processes in the operational business. . In order to implement the defined business guidelines, the integrated management system EMASplus was introduced. This ensures the continuous improvement process of WUQM Consulting towards a sustainable economy. The individual tasks and responsibilities in the management system are documented in an internal responsibility matrix. The entire team of WUQM Consulting is actively involved in the implementation, further development and maintenance of the integrated management system. This is done through processes such as the Ecomapping\\u00ae methodology, the identification and evaluation of the relevant sustainability aspects in the FLIPO matrix, the development and continuation of the improvement program with defined responsibilities, the proposal for measures and the implementation of internal audits. In the operational business, sustainable practices are defined e.g. by the following guidelines and the signing of codes: . Directive on eco-fair procurement for office materials, IT products, cleaning products and occupational clothing, electricity supply, heat supply through biogas, food and beverages, and event management (introduced 01/2016).; Business Travel Directive for the promotion of public transport/rail transport and e-mobility (Hybrid vehicles, e-bikes) (planned until 07/2017).; Sustainability Code Fair Obligation of the Event Management (signed 07/2015) ; Training Partner of the German Sustainability Code: WUQM Consulting has been offering consulting services in the areas of sustainable management, environmental and quality management, energy and resource efficiency, risk management and the qualification of managers and employees for more than 20 years. Since 02/2017 WUQM Consulting has been supporting companies and public institutions through training on the application of the DNK. . 7. Control . The company discloses how and which performance indicators are used for sustainability in regular internal planning and control. It explains how appropriate processes ensure reliability, comparability and consistency of data for internal control and external communication. . With the introduction of the integrated management system EMASplus, an input-output analysis on the data base of 2014 was prepared for the first time. In the updated environmental statement 2017 the key figures of 2014, 2015 and 2016 are shown. However, comparability and use of the data for internal control is not possible so far, as WUQM Consulting changed its location in 2015. Currently, especially environmental key figures are collected. The balance sheet is to be extended over the years by sustainability indicators from the social and economic area. About the sustainability report with integrated environmental statement 2015 and the updated environmental statement 2017 the sustainability commitment of WUQM Consulting is presented externally transparent, credible and comprehensible. . Performance indicators for criteria 5 to 7 . Performance Indicator G4-56 Describe the values, principles and standards of conduct and conduct (codes of conduct and ethics) of the organization. . Corporate Guidelines; Sustainability Code Fair Obligations of the Event Industry; Eco-fair Procurement Directive; Business Travel Directive to promote the use of public transport/rail transport and e-mobility (in planning); Registration as a certified company according to EMAS and EMASplus . Incentive schemes . The company discloses how the target agreements and remuneration for managers and employees are also oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and long-term value creation. It is disclosed to what extent the achievement of these goals is part of the evaluation of the top management level (CEO/CEO) by the supervisory board. . In half-yearly employee discussions with the management, individual goals are defined and evaluated, how the employee can optimally participate in the long-term added value of WUQM Consulting, depending on the competence, and what contribution the employee can make to the continuous improvement process of the environmental management system. Both are carried out in accordance with the company guidelines. An incentive system represents the employee's profit participation on the basis of a performance-related premium model, which is also designed individually. If the company generates a surplus, the employees are involved in this in the form of a distribution. As a micro enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting does not have a control body (supervisory board/counsel) for the management. . Performance indicators for criterion 8 . Performance Indicator G4-51a Compensation Policy \\u2013 Report on the remuneration policy for the highest supervisory body and senior executives. . As a micro-enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting does not have a supervisory body (supervisory board/advisory board) for the management. No key figures are collected for the remuneration policy of the management. . Performance Indicator G4-54 Specify the ratio of the annual remuneration of the highest paid employee in each country with significant business activities to the average level (median) of the total annual remuneration of all employees (excluding the highest paid employee) in the same country. . As a micro-enterprise with 1-10 employees, WUQM Consulting has only one location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The indicator has not yet been collected. . 9. Participation of Stakeholder Groups . The company discloses how social and economically relevant stakeholders are identified and integrated into the sustainability process. It discloses whether and how a continuous dialogue with them is maintained and how its results are integrated into the sustainability process. . In the course of a workshop, the WUQM Consulting team identified the diverse stakeholder groups that are directly or indirectly affected by the company's decisions or have claims to the company. A stakeholder map shows the degree of concern (intensity of communication, claims and influence) of the stakeholder groups (see Sustainability Report with integrated Environmental Statement 2015, p. 9). The dialogue with the customers (permanent and project customers) is maintained through the implementation of the services of WUQM Consulting (consultations, trainings, audits, etc.) and by means of a questionnaire for satisfaction with the services provided. The feedback of the customers finds influence in the employee discussions and in the meetings of the management. The competencies, needs and goals of the permanent employees are examined in half-yearly employee discussions with the management and taken into account in the company planning. For the integrated management system there is an internal proposal system, which is used as a pool of ideas for measures to improve the sustainability performance of WUQM Consulting. Communication to governmental institutions and regional stakeholders is carried out on a discontinuous basis and if necessary, e.g. for the implementation of joint events. The suppliers of WUQM Consulting are limited to few, environmentally-oriented and partly also certified providers. There are usually very long-term and trusting business relationships. Supporting stakeholders are cooperation partners, networks, business associations, regional organisations and local neighbours. The above-mentioned forums and stakeholders serve WUQM Consulting for the exchange of experience, for the use of synergies, for project generation and as multipliers for the offer and commitment of WUQM Consulting. For a more targeted participation of the identified stakeholders is provided a team workshop for the analysis of the needs of the stakeholders and their integration into the sustainability process. . Performance indicators for criterion 9 . Performance Indicator G4-27 Name the most important issues and concerns that have arisen through stakeholder involvement and how the organisation has responded to those important issues and concerns, including through reporting. Name the stakeholder groups that have addressed the key issues and concerns. . Extension of the EMAS environmental management system to include the EMASplus sustainability management system, in particular the integration of social concerns into the management system; application of the sustainability code in a fair manner when carrying out own events; health management with specific offers for our own employees (in planning) . In the personal contact with customers and via the questionnaire on customer satisfaction, the customer's concerns are brought to us. Here, in particular, extensions or individualizations of our services are made. However, the customers and partners of WUQM Consulting are also important drivers for the own management system. WUQM Consulting has implemented the following: The following were realized from the ideas and suggestions of the employees via the internal proposal system: . Initiation and implementation of EMAS certification; conduct of a coaching for the management and employees for team building as well as for the optimization of the internal organization and workflows; possibility of leasing e-bikes for employees (in planning); compensation of CO2 emissions for a climate-neutral business operation (in planning) . 10. Innovation and product management . The company discloses how it contributes through appropriate processes to improving the sustainability of its own resource use and users through innovations in products and services. It also explains whether and how their current and future impact is assessed in the value chain and in the product lifecycle for the essential products and services. . everyday contact with customers from different industries in positions relevant for sustainable development (sustainability, environmental, energy, quality management, data protection officer, etc.) in companies and public institutions; intensive regular exchange in networks, forums, working groups and convoys; continuous training and further training of employees . WUQM Consulting is always open to external impulses and suggestions and strives to take up innovative products and current social developments in its work. It plays a pioneering role, for example, by introducing the integrated EMASplus management system, by ensuring fair compliance with the sustainability code and by using a plug-in hybrid vehicle by the management. WUQM Consulting has the necessary access to the relevant and up-to-date information: With the introduction of environmental, quality or sustainability management systems, it strengthens the sustainable management of organizations. Positive effects are achieved through long-term change and improvement processes. Clear savings targets are set, among other things, in the areas of waste, energy, emissions and continuous work on improving environmental performance. All customers, e.g. EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme), publish an externally tested environmental declaration in which the ecological effects of their services and products are described and are documented with indicators. In the spring of 2014, WUQM conducted the study \\\"EMAS - Satisfaction and Exploitation of EMASplus, Environmental Psychological Results Evaluation on the basis of a Customer Survey\\\" in cooperation with a Research and Development Office. 28 companies were asked about their satisfaction with EMAS and the EMASeasy methodology and their potential for expanding the existing environmental management system to a sustainability management system. All companies developed and implemented an ambitious environmental program. Above all, the employee involvement by the EMASeasy methodology was rated as particularly positive by 89 percent. Whether the final environmental explanation was of benefit and was asked for was affirmed by 70 percent. As other positive effects, transparency, encouragement for savings, improvement of the quality standard as a whole or an increase in environmental awareness among employees were mentioned. . Performance indicators for criterion 10 . Performance indicator G4-FS11 Percentage of financial assets subject to a positive or negative selection test according to environmental or social factors. . This indicator is not relevant due to the current business situation and position. . 11. Utilization of natural resources . The company discloses the extent to which natural resources are used for business activities, including materials as well as the input and output of water, soil, waste, energy, area, biodiversity and emissions for the life cycle of products and services. . In 2014, WUQM Consulting prepared an input-output analysis for the first time and has continued it annually since then. The balance sheet contains several environmental indicators that document, among other things, the resource consumption of WUQM Consulting and, if necessary, the improvement of environmental performance: Basic data Input Output The exact consumption data and specific environmental indicators can be found in the updated 2017 Environmental Statement. . Useful area: heated net floor space in square metres; employees: number of full-time equivalents, share of women, share of full-time jobs, share of permanent contracts .

Resource management . The Company shall disclose the qualitative and quantitative objectives it has set for its resource efficiency, in particular the use of renewable energies, the increase in raw material productivity and the reduction of the use of ecosystem services, the measures and strategies it pursues, how they have been or are to be fulfilled in the future and where it sees risks. . The corporate guidelines stipulate that WUQM Consulting takes into account the impact of its actions on the environment and assumes its social responsibility in its corporate decisions. This implies a careful use of natural resources, which is reflected in the following measures: . Company headquarters: move to a former brewery in W\\u00fcrzburg with offices in the historic brewhouse of B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u (renovation in 2014 to EnEV standard), equipped to 100% with energy-efficient LED lighting; from 01.01.2018: conversion to 100% green electricity, laying of environmentally friendly floor coverings from recycled material and renewable raw materials; resource and energy-saving practices in everyday office life: exclusive use of recycling paper (blue angel), pre-setting of the printer to double-sided SW printing, use of batteries (no batteries), refill and reusable packaging (e.g. hand soap, glass bottles, sodastream) as well as use of cloth towels in the sanitary rooms, equipment with flow limiters on taps and water-saving buttons on toilets, separation of waste into four fractions (paper, plastic, residual waste and biowaste), switching of electrical equipment with socket strips outside working hours; implementation of the Directive on eco-fair procurement with minimum criteria and waste. a. for the new purchase of products (office furniture, office materials, IT equipment, food and beverages, cleaning products, occupational clothing etc.); sustainable mobility (objective 2017: 15% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to 2014): use of the railway as a primary means of transport for business trips (measurement: BahnCard 50 with 100% green electricity for all employees), leasing of a plug-in hybrid vehicle for the management, installation of two e-charging stations at the company parking spaces, possibility for employees to lease an e-bike, reimbursement of travel costs of the \\u00d6PNV ticket for employees for the work journey, introduction of a business travel directive (2018 in planning); sustainable event management (\\\"Green Meetings\\\"): implementation of events according to the sustainability code fair, i.e. as paper-free design (scripts on USBStick), extensive organic catering of suppliers with regional and seasonal offer, extension of the seminar portfolio with webinars (2018 in planning) .

Until now, the consumption of electricity and heat has been collected for this indicator. Due to delays in the calculation of ancillary costs, the current data for the year 2016 are not yet available. They will be added soon after their receipt. With the move to the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areal in W\\u00fcrzburg in November 2015, a change of the electricity and heat supplier took place. Currently, WUQM Consulting is still bound to a framework contract of the project development company of the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u-Areals. At the beginning of 2018 the transition to 100% green electricity is planned. In the complete renovation of the listed building and the office premises, energy efficiency measures were in the foreground. For the heating of the rooms, a low-temperature floor heating system is used, which is supplied via a central gas combustion plant. In summer, the office spaces can be cooled over the floor by approx. 2 \\u00b0C. . Performance indicator G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption. . Refurbishment according to the ENEV standard in 2014; installation of insulating glass windows; low-temperature floor heating and cooling, which is supplied with heat via a central gas combustion system . As a result of the relocation in autumn 2015, it is not yet possible to make a comparison between 2014, 2015 and 2016 and to make savings on concrete measures or indicators. The new building has other structural requirements: The following measures to reduce energy consumption were implemented with the move to the new premises: . Installation of 100% LED lighting; procurement of energy efficient appliances: refrigerator and dishwasher class A++, energy-saving induction stove . Performance indicator G4-EN8 Total water abstraction by source. . Water and wastewater --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . Hot water -- tc-- m3 -- tc-- 3.0 -- tc-- 2.9 -- tc-- k.A. .

Water consumption per employee -- tc-- m3 -- tc-- 3,4 -- tc-- 3,1 -- tc-- 1,2 . For the indicator hot water consumption, there are no data available for 2016. These are supplemented as soon as they are available. According to the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (Sustainable Building Assessment System), the average consumption for office and administrative buildings is about 20 to 30 litres per working day and employee. At WUQM Consulting, consumption has so far been around 19 litres per working day and employee. Thus, this is just below the average. . Performance indicator G4-EN23 Total weight of waste by type and method of disposal. . The data for the collection of the key figures on waste generation have been estimated since 2016 on the volume of waste containers and the frequency of their emptying. The waste is separated into four fractions (paper/cartonage, plastic/packaging waste, residual waste and biowaste) and collected in a common waste collection room on the B\\u00fcrgerbr\\u00e4u site. The waste is disposed of in specified cycles via the collection system of the city cleaners, an EMAS-certified own operation of the city of W\\u00fcrzburg. Dangerous waste does not occur in office operations. The large amount of paper and cardboard in 2015 is due to the move in November 2015. . Waste generation --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . Residual waste -- tc-- kg -- tc-- 31 -- tc-- 31 -- tc-- 47 . Organic waste -- tc-- kg -- tc-- -- -- tc-- -- -- tc-- 50 .

Recycling rate --tc-- % --tc-- 88 --tc-- 93 --tc-- 87 . 13. Climate-related emissions . The company discloses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol or standards based on it and sets its own emission reduction targets. . WUQM Consulting produces emissions through professional mobility, indirectly through the consumption of electricity and heat, and indirectly through the consumption of office paper. We have achieved the target of reducing CO2 emissions from mobility by 15 percent (i.e. by 1,8250 kg) by the end of 2017. CO2 emissions from diesel consumption have fallen continuously since 2015 and amounted to only 9,449 kg of CO2 (approx. 3,000 litres) in 2017, compared with 12,172 kg in 2015 (approx. 3,900 litres). This means a saving of 2,723 kg (22 percent) of CO2 emissions. This goal was achieved by: Avoiding business travel through video and telephone conferences; bundling of business trips, use of the railway, replacement of a diesel vehicle by a plug-in hybrid in January 2017. The railway kilometres have therefore increased from 10,639 km (2016) to 29,128 km (2017). Despite the growing business, the performance of the two company cars has decreased from 63,000 km (2014) to 50,220 km in 2017. The goal of reducing indirect emissions from paper consumption is to save paper and use of 100% recycled paper with the Blue Angel. The basic settings of the printer are pre-set in black and double-sided. Customer correspondence is predominantly digital. Advertising for own events and seminars is also predominantly digital. Despite the growth in personnel and increased number of in-house seminars, indirect emissions from paper consumption with 38.6 kg of CO2 remained almost the same compared to 2015 with 38.1 kg of CO2. In 2014 and 2015, no indirect CO2 emissions were generated by the purchase of electricity from 100% hydropower. For the heat consumption from heating oil, values of 10,422 kg (2014) and 9,732 kg (2015) were generated. From 01.11.2015, the WUQM has acquired new office space and heats the rooms by means of economical low-temperature floor heating with natural gas, thus achieving enormous CO2 savings. 2015: Consumption of 30,413 kWh, CO2 emissions: 9,732 kg CO2 2016: Consumption of 5,580 kWh, CO2 emissions: 1,400 kg CO2 The purchase of 100% green electricity from renewable energies is very important for WUQM and will be implemented in the coming months. Further reduction targets and measures for 2018/2019 will only be developed in March/April and will be published in the next validated environmental statement in May 2018.The calculation of greenhouse gas and air pollutants volumes is not based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), but on the Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems (GEMIS) and the sustainability calculator of the Pro Recycling Paper (IPR) initiative. . Performance indicators for criterion 13 . Performance indicator G4-EN15 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1). . Emissions --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 .

Performance indicator G4-EN17 Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). . Emissions --tc-- Unit --tc-- 2014 --tc-- 2015 --tc-- 2016 . CO2 emissions from paper consumption (0.93g/kg) --tc-- kg CO2e --tc-- 36 --tc-- 38 --tc-- 36 . Further indirect CO2 emissions from WUQM Consulting result from the consumption of office paper (100% recycled paper, Blue Angel). The sustainability calculator of the Initiative Pro Recycling Paper (IPR) is used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions. . Performance indicator G4-EN19 Reduction of GHG emissions. . A concrete environmental goal is to reduce CO2 emissions from mobility by 15% by the end of 2017 compared to 2014. In order to achieve this goal, internal measures were carried out to promote cycling, public transport and the use of rail as a primary means of transport for business trips. In addition, a plug-in hybrid vehicle was leased by the management in January 2017. At the end of 2017, data on possible savings in CO2 emissions and other air pollutants are available for the first time. According to the environmental balance of Deutsche Bahn, the following savings were achieved by WUQM Consulting through journeys by rail instead of journeys by car between 01/2016 and 12/2016 (assuming rail and car journeys are identical from mileage): .

The company reports on how it complies with nationally and internationally recognised standards on employee rights and promotes the participation of employees in the company and in the company's sustainability management, which goals it sets itself, which results have been achieved so far and where it sees risks. . A goal defined in the company guidelines of WUQM Consulting is to promote the motivation and satisfaction of employees. The basis is the compliance with the applicable legal regulations for occupational health and safety in Germany, as employees are insured under German labour law and WUQM is only active nationally. Important here are above all the occupational safety law, the mother protection law, the workplace regulation with all relevant workplace directives (especially for VDU workplaces) and the occupational safety regulation. The internal safety specialist (currently: Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig) keeps the risk assessment, operating instructions and other legally required documents up-to-date and carries out the annual employee training on occupational health and safety. In addition, we have been EMAS certified since April 2016 and also meet the requirements of the EMASplus guideline. The EMASplus sustainability management system has a holistic understanding of corporate social responsibility and takes into account environmental aspects (through compliance with the EMAS regulation and the UM- Standard ISO 14001) also provides economic and social aspects. The guideline is based on the internationally recognized CSR guide ISO 26000 on corporate social responsibility. Its seven core topics are organisation management, fair business and business practices, human rights, consumer concerns, work practices, involvement and development of the community. To ensure good and fair work practices, half-yearly employee discussions are held. For more information see Sustainability Report 2015, p. 27. In weekly team meetings, an exchange is held on the current projects and the available resources of the employees. Within the framework of the sustainability management system EMASplus, annual internal audits and every two years external audits are carried out by an EMAS environmental expert. The internal team, led by the sustainability representatives, initiates new objectives, the improvement programme and the continued development of the management system. In the monitoring of the sustainability performance of WUQM Consulting, there are so far only few indicators on economic and social aspects. . 15. Equal opportunities . The company discloses how it implements national and international processes and what goals it has to promote equal opportunities and diversity, occupational safety and health protection, participation, integration of migrants and people with disabilities, adequate pay and agreement of family and work, and how it implements them. . WUQM Consulting aims to achieve an honest and regular exchange with its employees (see company guidelines). This will be implemented in particular in the context of six-monthly employee discussions with the management. In this context, the framework conditions such as workload, organisation, qualification, responsibility as well as an appropriate remuneration are discussed. Employees' salary wishes are accepted and evaluated in terms of their feasibility. As there are no fixed remuneration structures for corporate consulting, the quality of our services must convince the customer in order to be able to manage successfully. On the part of the management, the aim is to pay employees appropriately and fairly in order to bind professionals to the company in the long term. This is implemented by a performance-related salary model, with which employees are involved in the company's success. This means that they receive a performance premium in addition to their net salary at the end of the financial year. There is no difference between gender, appearance, origin, religion or view of values. Qualified applications from abroad are particularly taken into account in order to offer employment opportunities to people of other backgrounds. However, this has first occurred. All employees are employed full-time for an unlimited period and full-time as desired. A flexible flexitime model and the possibility of mobile work facilitate the reconciliation of family and work for the employees. Men and women are treated equally and work on projects largely independently. The proportion of women in projects is 50 percent. For the health promotion and prevention of back pain, three height-adjustable tables have been created, which allow for a change between standing and sitting work. Access to office spaces is possible for people with disabilities by means of elevator. . (ii) the need to improve the quality of training; . The company discloses the objectives it has set and the measures it has taken to promote employability, i.e. the ability to participate in the working and professional world of all employees, and to adapt it to demographic trends, and where it sees risks. . Each employee is entitled to three training days per year. A competence matrix for the WUQM Consulting team is used to optimize the internal work organisation. The permanent recruitment of the personnel underlines the strategy of the management to develop and maintain employees in the company in the long term. The continuous training and rapid self-responsible project cooperation brings positive effects both for the company and for the employees. WUQM Consulting employs employees with different vocational trainings and from different age groups. In the field of health, preventive approaches are mainly pursued. In this way, height-adjustable tables have been procured, which enable employees to work flexibly in sitting or standing. The development of a health management system is currently being planned. . Performance indicators for criteria 14 to 16 . Performance indicator G4-LA6 Type of injury and rate of injury, occupational diseases, days lost and absence and total number of work-related deaths by region and sex. .

WUQM Consulting has introduced a binding guideline for eco-fair procurement, which defines minimum criteria for product properties in terms of environmental friendliness, recyclability and disposal, as well as for manufacturers and suppliers in terms of compliance with general human rights and environmental, occupational and health protection. For guidance, reference is made to trusted labels, certifications and product declarations, e.g. Blue Angel, Fairtrade, GEPA and GEPA fair+. Memo AG is our main supplier of office materials, which mainly refers to its goods from Germany and Europe and carries out an extensive audit of environmental and sustainability aspects prior to inclusion in the assortment. . Performance indicators for criterion 17 . Performance indicator G4-HR1 Total number and percentage of significant investment agreements and contracts that contain human rights clauses or have been examined from a human rights perspective. . As there are no investment agreements and contracts, this indicator is not collected. . Performance indicator G4-HR9 Total number and percentage of business locations audited for human rights or human rights implications. . 100%. WUQM Consulting has only one location in W\\u00fcrzburg. The company is EMAS and EMASplus certified. External validation has encouraged the introduction of a formal anti-corruption policy. . Performance indicator G4-HR10 Percentage of new suppliers verified on the basis of human rights criteria. . Based on its environmental procurement policy, WUQM Consulting is usually looking for (environmental) certified suppliers from the region to test products for environmental and social compatibility prior to inclusion in the product range. By mid-2018, WUQM Consulting intends to carry out a comprehensive supplier assessment with regard to sustainability criteria. If the assessment indicates that the negative effects in the supply chain are to be feared, appropriate measures will be taken. . G4-HR11 performance indicator Significant actual and potential negative human rights impacts in the supply chain and measures taken. . Since WUQM Consulting is a consulting company, human rights implications in the supply chain may be relevant for the procurement of office and IT equipment as well as for food. In order to fulfil its social responsibility, WUQM Consulting has introduced a guideline for eco-fair procurement and signed the sustainability code in a fair manner for the event industry. . 18. Community . The company shall disclose how it contributes to the community in the regions where it carries out essential business activities. . As a consulting company for the introduction of quality, environmental and sustainability management systems, WUQM Consulting supports customers throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. However, companies or public institutions within a radius of approx. 200 km are mainly advised from the W\\u00fcrzburg location. Seminars, workshops and information events are offered in line with the business fields. WUQM Consulting is a long-standing member of the Environmental Protection Association Unterfranken e.V. (FUU e.V.), whose first board is the managing director of WUQM Consulting, Dr. Stefan M\\u00fcssig. promotes sustainable business in the region of Lower Franconia through projects, working groups and seminar events.

In autumn 2019 \\u2013 almost exactly 120 years after the company\\u2019s founding \\u2013 we launched the biggest growth and innovation initiative in the history of Miele. The goal of this programme is to guide our independent family-owned company into the future from a position of strength. Exam- ples include a new organisational structure, a focus on new growth fields and advances in our digital expertise. Just a few months later, however, we faced an entirely different development: the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Miele has consistently focused on pro- tecting its employees as the top priority in coping with the challenges the pandemic has brought. To keep operations up and run- ning as far as possible at the same time, comprehensive protective measures were taken and maintained rigorously. Large parts of office operations were shifted to remote work from one day to the next. Almost all contacts with retailers went digital. The fact that we were able to conclude the year 2020 very successfully in eco- nomic terms in spite of the circumstances shows once again that trustworthy brands and outstanding quality serve as important anchors, providing stability even \\u2013 and espe- cially \\u2013 in times of crisis. But of everything we are grateful for, the biggest thanks go to our more than 20,000 employees. Since the start of the pandemic, they have been working under trying conditions, whether due to loss of earnings from shorter working hours or from additional stress caused by school and day care closures.

For the past 120 years, we at Miele have been guided by our founders\\u2019 maxim \\u201cImmer Besser\\u201d, adhering firmly to this idea even or especially in turbulent times. The past year was no exception, and we did not let up in our efforts to reach our sustainability goals. Quite the opposite, in fact: In October 2020, the Executive Board adopted a much more ambi- tious sustainability strategy, defining a new climate action strategy with ambitious climate targets in the process. As one of these aims, we are striving to reduce our CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 50 percent compared to 2019 levels by the year 2030. Miele is guided in these efforts by the central aim of the Paris Agreement, limiting global warming to signif- icantly below 2\\u00b0C \\u2013 or 1.5\\u00b0C if possible \\u2013 as compared to the pre-industrial era. The sci- entifically based confirmation of our climate targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (STBi) in the summer of 2021 has once again emphasised this. As the first step If 2020 has taught us one thing, it is that global crises cannot be resolved by taking a wait-and-see approach. Instead, they call for decisive action. That is also true of climate change, which poses a wide range of risks to Miele as a com- pany with worldwide value chains. But climate action is not the only area where we have set new goals for ourselves. In terms of our products, too, we plan to fur- ther sharpen our focus in the future on not only durability and efficient use, but also aspects such as recyclability, repairability and resource efficiency. At the same time, we need to explore new market opportu- nities through business models that are both innovative and sustainable. And last but not least, we are further expanding our work on digital responsibility in an effort to strengthen our customers\\u2019 trust in our increasingly digitally connected products. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Our work on sustainability reflects our pledge to uphold the ten universal prin- ciples of the UN Global Compact, which we joined back in 2004.

Miele aims to continuously delight its customers with unparalleled quality, innova- tive technology, perfect results and timeless elegance, while also playing a pioneering role in energy efficiency and environmental protection. \\u201cImmer Besser\\u201d, the prece- dent set by the company founders, sums it up. The owners and Executive Board feel an obligation towards the employees, cus- tomers, suppliers, the environment and society. Miele embodies partnership-based conduct towards its business partners, an em ployee-focused corporate culture as well as continuity of values, goals and leader- ship. The family-owned company is now in its fourth generation, with the two founding fami- lies Miele and Zinkann holding 100 percent of the shares. This ensures independence from the interests of external investors. In the core domestic appliance business, the company focuses on the Miele brand and its positioning in the premium segment. Digital products and services from the Smart Home division play an increasingly important role. INNOVATION AND GROWTH INITIATIVE In 2019, Miele began fundamentally reposi- tioning its organisation. The goal is to further expand on its leading market position in the premium segment in domestic and commer- cial appliances while also safeguarding the economic efficiency of the entire Miele Group on a lasting basis. The restructuring of worldwide sales activities is also among the biggest innovation and growth initiatives in the company\\u2019s history, with the focus shifting to aspects such as markets with high potential, like China and North America. Beyond that, Miele is also ramping up its investments in the company\\u2019s digital exper- tise and has established a site in Amsterdam focusing on digital marketing and digital sales. To strengthen corporate responsibility within the organisation, Miele has pooled together its operational business in eight independently operating business units (BUs): Laundry, Dishwashing, Cooking, Refrigeration, Professional, Customer Service, Small Domestic Appliances (SDA) and the recently created New Growth Factory. It opens up new fields of business with bright prospects for the future. COMPANY HEADQUARTERS G\\u00fctersloh has been the headquar- ters of the Miele Group since 1907. EXECUTIVE BOARD The Executive Board consists of five Executive Directors with equal voting rights. These include two Executive Directors who act as representatives of the families of owners, as well as three Executive Directors with divi- sional responsibility who are not associated with the families.

The chain ends with recycling or disposal of the appliances. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SUPPLY CHAIN New business models and digital solutions are helping Miele open up new markets. However, this can also lead to new challenges regarding sustainability. Increasingly complex supply chains and an increasing scarcity of raw materials require more supply chain transparency. However, partnership-based supplier relationships and a shared commitment to respecting human rights and greater environmental protection offer opportunities. PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION PRODUCTION SALES & TRANSPORT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Increasing energy and resource efficiency in production is helping offset higher energy and material costs. For companies with a high level of vertical integration, the shortage of skilled workers also presents a risk. It can have a negative impact on productivity. Employee satisfaction is a decisive factor in meeting this challenge. Transport-related emis- sions are at the centre of public debate. In addition, the number of regulations is increa- sing. Logistics must be made more environ- mentally friendly. EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES USE RECYCLING & DISPOSAL Shifts in the market can have a positive or negative impact on the demand for sus- tainable products. The promotion of sustain- able consumption is an essential opportunity. Around the world, raw materials are becoming scarcer and their costs are rising. This requires comprehensive measures in order to conserve natural resources. Durable and recyclable products make a positive contribution, as does the increased use of recycled materials.

In light of the growing threat posed by climate change and the increasing scarcity of resources, Miele\\u2019s strategic focus today lies on the ambitious con- tinued expansion of its sustainability strategy, which states new targets for climate action, environmental protection and other urgent issues.

It is intended to serve as a model for all employees in their daily activities. Long-term objectives form the framework to this end. In 2016, Miele there- fore set out 15 strategic targets that are to be achieved by 2025. The company has already made significant progress on the path to completion. When it comes to climate action, for instance, energy con- sumption continued to fall at all locations in 2020. At the same time, Miele suc- ceeded in significantly reducing its CO2 emissions by cutting Scope 1 and 2 emis- sions by 40 percent compared to 2019, to name just one example. When it comes to resource conservation, the company deci- sively pursued the goal of making Miele appliances leaders in sustainable product design and integrated efficiency, allowing Miele to further increase the percentage of products sold with the highest energy effi- ciency ratings. Customers also continue to see Miele\\u2019s sustainability performance as very good worldwide, according to studies such as the 2020 \\u201cGr\\u00fcne Marken des Jahres\\u201d (Green brands of the year) survey by the international market research insti- tute YouGov and the magazine stern. In the study, consumers voted Miele number one in the category of electronic appliances. At the same time, Miele is aware that global challenges such as climate change have grown even more intense in recent years. Digitalisation and rising consumer expec- tations also result in new topics that need to be addressed. As a result, Miele car- ried out a large-scale project during the reporting period to ensure an even more ambitious approach to tackling indi- vidual topics of the sustainability strategy. This is especially true when it comes to climate action, environmental protection, the sustainability of Miele products and a responsible approach to digitalisation. STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT In the reporting period, Miele launched its global Design2Excellence > innovation and growth initiative to further strengthen the company\\u2019s competitiveness and future via- bility on a sustainable basis. The further development of the Miele sustainability strategy also counts towards this goal. Miele is doing justice to the high value of sus- tainability for the company and the brand through very ambitious new targets. At the same time, sustainability is being anchored even more firmly within the organisation and given a higher profile in the way the First place in the \\u201cGr\\u00fcne Marken des Jahres\\u201d consumer study in the electronic appliances category. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS company presents itself, including in how it communicates with customers. The revised strategy concentrates on three fields of focus: climate action, sustain- able products and packaging, and digital responsibility. These areas are ones in which the company can make a signifi- cant additional contribution to sustainability. Moreover, they are of particular relevance and urgency from a social perspective. From 2021, the targets and measures in the fields of focus will be further refined and specified in a sustainability programme. By drawing up their own sustainability programmes on the basis of the central strategy, the business units \\u2013 along with relevant central departments such as pur- chasing, human resources and logistics \\u2013 will be involved closely in implementing the enhanced sustainability strategy. FIELD OF FOCUS: CLIMATE PROTECTION Containing climate change and adapting to its impact are among the most pressing issues of our time. As a family-owned com- pany with worldwide value chains that is aware of its responsibility, Miele attaches particular importance to this global 12  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 challenge. That is why the company devel- oped a comprehensive climate action strategy during the reporting period and defined ambitious targets to support it. The strategy was adopted by the Executive Board in October 2020. At its core is avoiding, reducing and offsetting CO2 emissions. of Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint is attributable to these Scope 3 emissions, making it the key to > reducing emissions. Despite the vast complexities, Miele is taking a sys- tematic approach to this challenge and setting itself a goal in accordance with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative in this area as well. When it comes to the targets, Miele is guided by the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to significantly below 2\\u00b0C \\u2013 or 1.5\\u00b0C if possible \\u2013 as com- pared to the pre-industrial era. To ensure that Miele\\u2019s climate targets make an effec- tive contribution to achieving this goal, the company joined the internationally recog- nised > Science Based Targets initiative (STBi) in January 2021. Its membership is associated with an obligation to pursue a science-based emissions reduction target. One of the first interim goals is to achieve CO2 neutrality at all locations in 2021 as relates to the company\\u2019s own emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions attributable to energy suppliers (Scope 2). At the same time, Miele aims to reduce these emissions by 50 percent compared to 2019 by 2030. To do so, the company will make investments with a focus on improving the > energy effi- ciency of Miele\\u2019s locations and production plants while expanding the in-house gener- ation of electricity from renewable sources. In the medium and long term, the goal is also to significantly reduce CO2 emis- sions during the use of products, as in the past, and during the purchasing of goods and services (Scope 3). A substantial share FIELD OF FOCUS: SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING The second field of focus looks at Miele\\u2019s products and the way they are packaged. As the aim here is to further improve their sustainability scorecard, the tasks at hand include closing material cycles through the > use of recyclates or by improving the ability to repair products, to name just two exam- ples. The latter contributes to the exceptional durability of Miele products, which has proven to be > valuable from an ecological per- spective. Increasing resource efficiency is another item on the agenda. The goal is to ensure supply security for Miele in the long term while preserving reserves of raw mate- rials for future generations. Miele plans to lay the groundwork for achieving this goal during product development. With regard to the > packaging used in shipping, a project team is tasked with continuously reviewing alter- native materials so that Miele can continue switching to more environmentally friendly solutions. Miele also strives to use recycled or recyclable materials more often for the packaging of cleaning and care products. In addition, the company is working on new sus- tainable > business models that are designed to open up additional market opportunities. In order to achieve its climate targets, Miele also opts for generating its own electricity from renewable sources.

Miele therefore further developed its strategy in the fields of data protection and information security in the reporting period. Part of those efforts includes drawing up a \\u201cdigital product promise\\u201d that ensures the ability of consumers to use the digital functions of Miele products securely and in the long term. The relationship between the key topics and the SDGs is also indicated by the size of the circles on the materiality matrix. As part of the > further development of the sustainability strategy, Miele reviewed the find- ings of the analysis with regard to their current relevance and decided that they remained applicable. The matrix therefore continues to provide guidance for defining the focal points of Miele\\u2019s sustainability approach. CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS MATERIALITY [GRI 102-46/-47] Miele performs materi- ality analyses to determine the focal points of the sustainability strategy and reporting. In the process, the company looks into the potential impact of its business activities on sustainable development and gauges the expectations of external stakeholders in relation to the company. The most recent comprehensive > materiality analysis was performed in 2018. The global reference framework of the analysis was based on the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustain- ability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analysed topics were subsequently compiled and pre- sented in accordance with the standards of the GRI in a > materiality matrix. The hori- zontal axis of the materiality matrix presents the influence of external factors (outside-in), while the vertical axis presents Miele\\u2019s impact (inside-out) on the topic in question. In this report\\u2019s subchapters, Miele describes how the material topics are managed and what kind of progress the company made during the reporting period. In 2015, the United Nations adopted > 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are at the heart of the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Devel- opment. The SDGs aim to address some of the most urgent global challenges from a sustainability perspective and reduce extreme poverty. Miele is expressly committed to the SDGs. The family-owned company makes a contribution to sustainable develop- ment through SDGs 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 in particular.

This applies equally to the produc- tion of Miele appliances and to their use and disposal, and also includes the company\\u2019s supply chain. Miele manages issues such as the conservation of resources, human rights, occupational safety and climate protection through an effective organisational structure using certified management systems. Compli- ance management ensures that applicable laws and Miele\\u2019s own guidelines are always observed. SYSTEMATIC SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT responsible for advancing the sustainability strategy in close cooperation with the Execu- tive Board, was expanded and renamed Corporate Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs (SRA) in 2021. Its renaming is an important signal within the company as to the important role of sustainability today and in the future. Along with many other departments, TPE was also responsible for implementing and moni- toring the sustainability strategy. The department heads at the company\\u2019s headquar- ters and the heads of the business units, as well as the heads of the sales regions and the heads of the sales subsidiaries, are responsible for ensuring that the objectives are achieved. Miele performs a systematic comparison of the objectives and key figures on sustainability performance on an annual basis. SUSTAINABILITY ORGANISATION Central sustainability management committees Executive Board Sustainability Board controls and decides Initiatives develop overarching solutions for focus topics [GRI 102-18/-20] Sustainability is ultimately the responsibility of the five-member Executive Board. The Board specifies the strategic direction, adopts objectives and defines indicators for measuring progress.

By reorganising the central Sustainability Com- mittee, Miele is working towards one of the main targets of the enhanced sustainability strategy: anchoring sustainability even more firmly throughout the company. Unlike in the past with the Sustainability Committee, the entire Miele Executive Board is accordingly represented on the new Sustainability Board, where it comes into contact with the heads and representatives of all relevant areas. The heads of the busi- ness units also belong to the Sustainability Board. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS [GRI 102-12/-16] A variety of principles and international guidelines to which Miele is committed form the basis for sustainability management: Corporate philosophy: prescribed principles, for example from the areas of quality and product safety, environmental protection, energy management, employee and cus- tomer orientation, or regarding specific sustainability aspects. These principles apply to all employees. Code of conduct of the > German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers\\u2019 Association (ZVEI) for socially responsible corporate management Code of conduct of the European Com- mittee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers > APPLiA (formerly CECED) for corporate social responsibility Code of conduct as part of the Association for Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics (BME) > compliance initiative to reduce compliance risks in the supply chain During its existence, the Sustainability Committee met at regular intervals, most recently convening four times in 2019. The committee dealt with the latest regulatory developments and discussed the resulting requirements for Miele. Examples include the EU regulation on energy consumption labelling, the European Strategy for Plastics and Germany\\u2019s National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights. Due to the further development of the sustainability strategy, the Sustainability Committee did not hold any official meetings in 2020. Instead, the Executive Board and the relevant areas were involved in the development process at different intervals. The committee also helped to oversee the process of imple- menting the sustainability strategy at plant level. Responsibility for doing so was handed over to the Sustainability Board in December 2020.

It combines all the tools and standards for adhering to various sustaina- bility requirements (see > table). The integrated management system is regularly reviewed in internal and external audits. The latest cer- tificate for quality, environmental protection, energy management and occupational health and safety was issued on 15 December 2020 and is valid until 14 December 2023. The FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS certificate for social standards is valid until 25 July 2022. The employees who are responsible for the individual areas of the management system report regularly on their progress to the Executive Board. In addition, the relevant departments at the locations in G\\u00fctersloh and Bielefeld have also been certified according to the ISO 13485 standard for quality management of med- ical products. The certifications in line with the SA8000 social standard will be succes- sively renewed for all locations by July 2022. 90 internal and external audits were conducted as part of quality management in 2020. 17  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Overview PRODUCTION SITES G\\u00fctersloh Arnsberg Bielefeld B\\u00fcnde Euskirchen Lehrte Oelde Warendorf B\\u00fcrmoos (Austria) Bra\\u015fov (Romania) Dongguan (China) Uni\\u010dov (Czech Republic) Ksawer\\u00f3w1) (Poland) MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Products Tools and standards Washing machines, washer dryers, electronic components, foundry Cooker hoods Dishwashers for domestic and commercial purposes, washer-disinfectors, vacuum cleaners Steam ovens, hob units, warming drawers Electric motors, cable feels, fans Laundry machines, rotary ironers Cookers, ovens, Dialog oven Plastic parts Metal components Electronic components Vacuum cleaners Washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers Production FACTS & FIGURES ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environment), ISO 45001 (Occupational safety), SA8000 (Social standard) ISO 50001 (Energy) 1) The new location in Ksawer\\u00f3w gained certification in May 2021.

The certification of the European company locations involves a matrix certification procedure. The Dongguan location plans and organises its certification independently, but remains closely interlinked with the Miele management system and the MES. In all cases, external auditors check the processes that are relevant to the certification. In 2020, 29 external integrated management system audits were performed. That figure stood at 36 in 2019. No non-conformities were found in either year. Miele Material Group Management MGM INTERNAL PROGRESS REVIEW Employees [GRI 412-1/-2] In addition to external auditing, Miele operates an internal auditing process. As a self-monitoring system, it allows Miele THE MIELE SUCCESS SYSTEM The integrated management system is inter- connected with the Miele Success System (MES) in many places. Consisting of four elements, the MES standardises and optimises processes. The proprietary IMNU 2.0 product development system, for example, allows Miele to maintain an overview of all key development aspects, from pre-development to series maturity. IMNU 2.0 includes an > environmental checklist. In the Miele Value Creation System (MWS), on the other hand, resource conserva- tion is anchored as a central design principle, with defined targets for considerations such as the durability of operating materials or the allocation of resources. Moreover, the Quality Core Processes (Q-KP) help to ensure func- tional production processes that are free of disruption and keep errors to a minimum. With the aid of Material Group Management (MGM), Miele reviews sustainability aspects, among other things, throughout the entire procure- ment process as part of targeted supplier audits and other tools. AUDITS BY AN EXTERNAL PARTNER [GRI 412-1] The central quality management at the company headquarters in G\\u00fctersloh plans and manages all external auditing and certifi- cation procedures at all locations.

Internal auditors review the integrated management system, as well as all associated areas. They work through specific questions about the various processes and standards, and also examine the extent to which the legal and certifica- tion requirements, as well as those of Miele customers, are fulfilled. During the process, they note positive aspects, along with areas for improvement, non-conformities and other observations. In addition, the internal audi- tors arrange for improvement measures and monitor them during the next audit. Audi- tors with qualifications and experience that are relevant to the task guarantee that the audit is carried out appropriately. In the busi- ness year 2020, 61 internal audits took place.

In 2019, 98 audits took place, identifying two non-conformities related to energy management and occupa- tional health and safety. In response, Miele took both immediate and long-term measures. SUCCESSFUL RISK MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-11/-15] As a global company, Miele is exposed to a wide range of different risks. At the same time, developments in the company\\u2019s environment offer many opportu- nities for its business activities. Identifying and assessing non-financial risks plays a pivotal role in risk management at Miele. The company performs careful anal- ysis to identify the areas along the value chain where negative effects on people and the environment could occur. In addition, Miele checks to see where rising sustaina- bility requirements for the company could negatively impact its business development. Risk management uses a two-level system at Miele that is composed of central representa- tives for risk management and decentralised risk managers within the company\\u2019s oper- ating units. The central risk management team coordinates the overall process of identifying and assessing risks by potential loss and probability of occurrence. It is also responsible for taking appropriate risk management measures. The decentralised risk managers report regularly on the risks they identify and take measures to avoid and mitigate them. SUSTAINABILITY: KEY CHALLENGES [GRI 102-11/-15, 201-2] The greatest sustaina- bility risks for Miele lie in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate goods, as well as in climate change. As a manufacturing company, Miele is dependent on the availability of certain raw materials. However, the consumption of limited natural resources continues to rise constantly worldwide. A potential scarcity of raw materials is therefore a significant sustainability risk for Miele. The adverse effects on the environment that are associ- ated with the extraction and processing of raw materials \\u2013 as well as the later use and disposal of the products \\u2013 pose a problem, as they could lead to the loss of biodiversity and increasing soil degradation, to name just a few examples. Such effects also have a direct impact on the financial situation of companies, for instance in the form of rising material costs. Against this backdrop, Miele is developing a variety of approaches to reduce the need for primary raw materials and conserve natural resources in the process. The principle of circularity (circular economy) is also of growing importance. Due to a lack of regulations and legal precedence, how- ever, its implementation is complicated. With its durable and > recyclable products, Miele is already making a positive contribution to resource conservation today. The greater use of recyclates and the manufacturing of particularly energy- and > resource-efficient products help to meet key sustainability targets related to the creation of a circular economy. Miele expects the trend towards increasingly complex supply chains to gain strength, which will make it even more difficult to create transpar- ency and avoid bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials and components. Such developments will also further complicate compliance and monitoring with regard to environmental and social standards along the supply chain. The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated the complexity of the supply chain and the resulting difficulties. Despite these challenges, Miele is committed to labour and human rights standards along the supply chain, as well as to compliance with the principles of sustainable corporate management. To this end, the company performs regular > supplier audits and requests certifications from its business partners in order to mitigate supply chain risks. At the same time, the company maintains supplier relationships based on a spirit of partnership and works with its suppliers to navigate the wide-ranging requirements. This partnership-based approach ensures transpar- ency and increases reliability. Climate change is a further material sus- tainability risk for companies. The scientific community almost unanimously expects global average temperatures to rise by 2.5 to four degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not drastically curbed. Extreme heat waves and rising sea levels already threaten natural resource ecosystems today, with a loss of pros- perity (including water and food shortages) a FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS potential reality in the long term. For companies like Miele, such effects could lead to tempo- rary or lasting interruptions in supply chains, or even the loss of locations. Besides the direct impact, climate change could also be asso- ciated with indirect risks due to factors such as regulatory requirements and changes in customer behaviour. Moreover, liability risks in connection with claims for compensation could become a burden. In light of these dan- gers and the challenges for humanity as a whole, Miele supports the 1.5-degree target of the United Nations and has joined the Sci- ence Based Targets initiative in order to develop > science-based climate targets. The company is focused on durability, as well as energy- and resource efficiency. Special emphasis is placed on the utilisation phase of its appli- ances, in which the environmental and climate impact is particularly pronounced in relation to the overall effect of Miele\\u2019s activities. More effi- cient, lower-CO2 logistics is another focal point. Miele plans to conduct a climate impact assessment to enable it to reliably evaluate the effect of climate change on its own business activities, as well as the resulting economic consequences. In the reporting period, Miele initially concentrated on identifying and prior- itising further measures to reduce CO2 emissions and improve data transparency. Since January 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant new sustainability risks for Miele, particularly in the field of occupational health and safety. > Various measures have been introduced at all locations to protect the company and its employees from infection with Covid-19. 20  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-16/-17, 206-1] Fair and cooperative conduct vis-\\u00e0-vis all internal and external partners is part of the corporate culture at Miele. Employees worldwide are obliged to abide by the law at all times, and to comply with internal guidelines, as well as self-imposed ethical and social standards. The Miele Code of Conduct was introduced in 2008 as a reflection of this obligation. It was most recently reviewed and updated in 2020. The Code, which is available on the Miele intranet, contains provisions on how to prevent bribery and corruption, as well as policies on proper conduct in relation to conflicts of interest, donations and sponsoring. It man- dates strict adherence to competition and antitrust legislation. In the reporting period, as in the years before it, there were no antitrust proceedings against Miele. > The Code of Conduct is based on the corporate philosophy, the ethical guidelines for procurement, the principles of the UN Global Compact, the SA8000 social standard and the APPLiA Code of Conduct (formerly CECED). Since 2011, Miele has been a member of the > BME compliance initiative, thereby underscoring its obligation to introduce processes for compliance and sustainable business practices at the company and implement them in its own supply chain. Compliance with individual aspects of the Code of Conduct, such as receiving and offering gifts, or how to deal with conflicts of interest, are reviewed in internal audits. In the event of violations, the company will agree on corrective measures. As a rule, however, it is the responsi- bility of the functional managers to put appropriate guidelines in place to ensure that their employees\\u2019 tasks are always carried out in compliance with applicable laws, internal rules and the self-imposed ethical and social standards. RAISING EMPLOYEES\\u2019 AWARENESS OF COMPLIANCE [GRI 102-17, 205-2, 412-2] It is mandatory for relevant groups of employees to participate in an online compliance training programme on the Miele Code of Conduct. This includes managers, as well as employees for whom the contents of the Miele Code of Conduct and the issue of compliance are particularly important. Such members of staff work primarily in the purchasing, internal audit, sales/field sales and specialist sales depart- ments or as customer services. New employees are automatically informed that they have to complete the programme. The programme is also open to all interested employees from other areas. To date, 4,122 employees participated in the online compliance training programme. 4,122 people worldwide have taken part in the training programme on the Code of Conduct, 409 of them during the reporting period. Since the end of 2016, employees at all locations involved in issues relating to competition and antitrust law are obliged to use this self-learning software on the subject of competition and antitrust legisla- tion. The programme ends with a test. Records are kept on whether tests were passed. There is also a legal management system for the areas of environmental protection, energy and occupational health and safety, and an information management software system addressing product-related regulation worldwide. OMBUDSPERSON AS A POINT OF CONTACT IF SUSPICIONS ARISE [GRI 102-17, 205-3, 419-1] Since 2010, employees have been able to turn to an external, independent ombudsperson \\u2013 or to their supervisor, HR management, internal audit, the works council or the Executive Board \\u2013 if they suspect corruption, fraud or theft within Miele\\u2019s sphere of influence. This option can also be used to report topics pertaining to human rights or data protection aspects. Employees, suppliers and third parties all over the world can take advantage of this service. The ombudsperson is addi- tionally available to provide advice on individual questions. All employees throughout the world, and all suppliers in Germany, are informed about the existence of the ombudsperson and their contact data FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS upon starting work or entering into a relation- ship with the company. If appropriate, suspicions are passed on to the central Auditing department for evaluation and review. The entire process can be handled anonymously upon request. No notifications relating to sustainability aspects were made to the ombudsperson during the reporting period. There were no instances of contracts with business partners being terminated or failing to be extended due to corruption- related violations. 21  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Stakeholder engagement Dialogue on an equal footing [GRI 102-40/-42] Miele\\u2019s products and pro- duction processes have different impacts on people and the environment. At the same time, the success and reputation of the company is also strongly influenced by the percep- tions, expectations, needs and decisions of its stakeholders. That is why Miele participates in > ongoing dialogue with all relevant stake- holder groups, including employees, customers and business partners, as well as associ- ations and interest groups, scientists and researchers, the general public, policymakers and legislators. Continuous stakeholder dia- logue helps the company to identify important trends and new developments, as well as risks and opportunities, at an early stage, and also to achieve common sustainability objectives. STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT [GRI 102-42/-43] Stakeholder dialogue takes place on many different levels at Miele. > Corporate Sustainability and Regulatory Affairs (SRA), formerly known as the Technical Product Management and Environmental Office (TPE), plays a pivotal role in this respect. It maintains numerous contacts with experts and other stakeholders and is active in associations, conferences and dialogue forums at EU level, which enables it to help shape policy dialogue. Other areas of the company also maintain close contact with the stakeholders that are relevant for them. Corporate communications speaks to media representatives and the public, while customer service and marketing are in con- tact with customers and business partners. Experts from the specialist departments, such as energy management or purchasing, as well as members of the Executive Board, take part in conferences, working groups and dialogue forums. Visitors to the Miele locations also give the company valuable feedback. At international locations, the dialogue is generally the respon- sibility of the sales subsidiaries, in consultation with the appropriate specialist departments at the company headquarters if necessary. On account of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible to involve stakeholders in the usual manner in the reporting year. Visits to Miele\\u2019s sites were more or less impossible, and most events with external participants had to be cancelled. Alternatively, a selec- tion of digital exchange formats were offered. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS ON OUR SUSTAINABILITY WORK Following the materiality process in 2018, stakeholder interviews with various opinion leaders and decision-makers were conducted in 2019. The goal was to gain deeper insights WIDESPREAD EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION Knowing the requirements of stakeholders is of tremen- dous importance for the further development of the > sustainability strategy, which is intended to serve in particular as a model for employees in their daily activi- ties. For this reason, Miele values a consistent understanding of sustainability that is anchored throughout the company. More than 100 employees got involved through a variety of workshops, video confer- ences and a wide-scale kick-off event, creating a broad basis for the upcoming transformation processes. CONTENTS 22  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 into strategic topics and identify specific areas of action and overlaps. The company talked to representatives of Germany\\u2019s Federal Min- istry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), the Federal Min- istry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and the consumer advocacy association Ver- braucher Initiative e. V. Miele employees were also able to access an interview with climate researcher Mojib Latif on the intranet. With over 2,000 views, the echo was positive. VALUABLE FEEDBACK FROM CUSTOMERS [GRI 102-43] Miele also conducts brand posi- tioning surveys several times a year. In these surveys, customers are asked a variety of ques- tions, including how well they believe Miele is meeting its ecological duties and what they think of the company\\u2019s commitment to sus- tainability. Between 2019 and the first quarter of 2021, Miele Brand Health Tracking, which is responsible for brand development, analysed some 54,000 interviews in 15 European coun- tries. In the interviews, customers were asked to evaluate the sustainability efforts of nine compa- nies from the industry. Miele took second place, just behind the top-ranked business and with a substantial lead over the third-placed company. These results confirm that Miele\\u2019s sustaina- bility performance is > perceived positively. POLITICAL INTERESTS [GRI 102-13] As a domestic appliance man- ufacturer, Miele is influenced by political decisions and legal requirements. The cor- responding guidelines and measures on issues such as the energy label, ecolog- ical design, hazardous substances and the circular economy have been drawn up pri- marily at a European level in recent years. Member states also draw up their own sus- tainability-related regulations that have an influence on Miele. Miele contributes its exper- tise to the debate surrounding the objectives and implementation of the guidelines through various > national and international commit- tees, commissions and associations. Topics such as national restrictions on substances and programmes for improving resource and material efficiency have also been dis- cussed in the process. In the reporting period, the discussions also centred on the digital- isation of products and services, as well as related questions regarding consumer pro- tection and the company\\u2019s responsibility. [GRI 102-13/-14] Miele maintains a contin- uous dialogue with political representatives who work at regional, national or European level. In its dealings with these representatives, the company argues that effective regulation for the environment, society and customers should be beneficial and should be realisable with as little additional bureaucratic effort as possible. To avoid distortions of competition, proposed legislation should also always be accompanied by a sound impact assessment that takes all potential market and environ- mental effects of the regulation into account and ensures transparency in terms of its imple- mentation. Since the end of 2015, Miele has been registered in the public transparency reg- ister for interest groups in Brussels to provide an insight into which representatives of the EU Commission, EU Parliament and the Euro- pean Council are in direct contact with Miele. WORK WITH ASSOCIATIONS In addition to advocating for certain political interests, company representatives are also involved in the work of national and international associations. One of the executive directors, Dr Markus Miele or Dr Reinhard Zinkann, is rep- resented on each of the boards of the German Central Association of the Electrical and Elec- tronics Industry ZVEI, the German Brands Association, the Stifterverband f\\u00fcr die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Donors\\u2019 association for the pro- motion of humanities and sciences) and \\u2013 at a regional level \\u2013 the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the trade association. Many members of staff are active on association and standardisation committees. Their tasks involve supporting the development of regulations and standards with their expertise while repre- senting Miele\\u2019s interests to the outside world. Miele actively works with associations through representatives of its sales subsidiaries in other EU member states and outside Europe as well. The company representatives then share the information they have gained on topics such as proposed legislation with the company itself. BENEFITING FROM PRACTICAL DIALOGUE [GRI 102-44] Miele also actively engages in dia- logue with environmentalists. For example, the company has been in regular contact with Envi- ronmental Action Germany (DUH) for several years now. As a result, the company engaged in dialogue regarding refrigerator disposal. Miele vehemently denies one organisation\\u2019s accusa- tions of improper conduct in this area and has presented a large number of audits and reviews of the disposal facilities to back up its rebuttal. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS For years, Miele has supported > FORUM WASCHEN as part of various different pro- jects in order to sensitise consumers and other members of society to more sustain- able washing, dishwashing and cleaning in the household. FORUM WASCHEN offers experts from government authorities, fed- eral ministries, research institutes, unions and manufacturers of detergents and house- hold appliances, as well as technical colleges, environmental organisations, universities and consumer associations, a platform where they can share their knowledge. It also contributes to the public debate surrounding sustainability through conferences, special events and exhi- bitions. In addition to practical input through presentations and lectures by experts, Miele supports the platform financially, for example by organising an annual multipliers\\u2019 meeting. 23  Miele

Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Focus on preventing infection The Covid-19 pandemic was associated with a variety of challenges for Miele as well in the reporting period. Miele responded quickly in early 2020 and launched a com- prehensive set of measures, including a significant expansion of remote working opportunities, the introduction of exclu- sive hygiene concepts, transparent communication for all employees and spe- cific guidance for managers. > Protecting employees and third parties from infec- tion was the top priority at all times during the development of appropriate strategies. COORDINATED APPROACH In February 2020, Miele set up a corona- virus coordination team consisting of senior staff from HR, purchasing, logistics, IT, facility management, communication and the com- pany medical service. This central committee also includes employees who coordinate the approach at the sales subsidiaries and the plants. The team defines necessary measures and recommends them to the Miele locations. The people in charge locally are respon- sible for their implementation in accordance with the statutory requirements. In Germany, those requirements include the protective measures adopted by federal and state gov- ernments. At the same time, the coronavirus coordination team monitors and discusses the latest infection figures. Local crisis teams, which are overseen by the appro- priate management staff at the locations, have been set up to round out the efforts. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY The family-owned company quickly devel- oped and implemented its > own hygiene concepts. In some cases, these concepts were ahead of the official measures or went beyond them. The technical conditions for mobile working were enhanced signif- icantly in a short space of time in order to enable a large portion of the workforce to work from home. In addition, buildings were modified by adding automated opening mechanisms to doors and setting up sepa- rating walls and hand sanitizer dispensers, to name just a few examples. Miele advo- cated for wearing face masks before it became commonplace to do so and for replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual conferences, events and business travel. Moreover, occupational health and safety officers partnered with the company med- ical service to provide advice on events. The company also introduced an occupancy con- cept for offices and meeting rooms to ensure 40 AirControl air purifiers were set up at the G\\u00fctersloh location. FACTS & FIGURES FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS CONTENTS the necessary physical distancing. In produc- tion, employees were newly divided into shift groups, and break times were staggered. To ensure sufficient fresh air in enclosed spaces, Miele developed concepts for ventilation sys- tems. A total of 40 mobile Miele > AirControl air purifiers were also set up at the G\\u00fctersloh location alone in meeting, training and break rooms, as well as at the site\\u2019s company child day-care centre. The G\\u00fctersloh facility man- agement team provided those responsible for facility management at Miele\\u2019s German loca- tions with a central source of knowledge and advice about the concept and other meas- ures. The cafeterias at the locations were subject to strict hygiene requirements in line with the latest official protective measures. The company also offered more flexible working hours in order to ease the burden on parents, who faced particularly daunting challenges during the pandemic due to the closures of day-care centres and schools. Parents also had the option of taking addi- tional time off to take care of their children. The family-owned company started offering testing options at the plant in G\\u00fctersloh and at other Miele production sites at an early stage in order to supplement the public health sys- tem\\u2019s efforts to identify cases of Covid-19. 262626  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Sustainability strategy Sustainability management Stakeholder engagement Miele and Covid-19 Miele and Covid-19 Despite increased precautionary and pro- tective measures, multiple cases of Covid-19 occurred among employees at the Miele plant in Euskirchen at the end of February 2021. As a consequence, the employees affected and the people they had been in contact with entered into quarantine. Regular manufacturing operations at the location were suspended until the isolation period had ended. COMMUNICATION AND SUPPORT pandemic, the company faced increased > challenges in this respect during the reporting period. At times, it was not pos- sible to obtain the usual volume of parts from suppliers, and the closure of retail stores cut off the personal connection to customers. In addition, production was interrupted at all plants due to the pandemic-related shortening of working hours in early 2020 \\u2013 and again a year later due to Covid-19 infections at the Euskirchen plant. Never- theless, Miele succeeded in keeping supply risks to a minimum by responding early. Keeping employees up to date at all times and offering them support options has been of the essence throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, Miele informed employees and managers of the latest developments and necessary measures at the locations by e-mail on a regular basis during the reporting period. Employees without personal intranet and company e-mail access had the option to receive important information through a mes- senger service on their smartphones. Miele also set up a Corona Information Center on the intranet with comprehensive infor- mation and an FAQ section. All members of the workforce are invited to contact the corona virus coordination team directly if they have any additional questions. Recom- mended courses of action were provided specifically for management staff on topics such as how to handle suspected cases. Miele offered early testing for employees at some locations to determine the number of Covid-19 infections.

Featuring timelessly elegant > design they are also crafted to be intuitive and as accessible as possible for all users. The company bases its product development activ- ities on sustainability criteria of its own that exceed the legal specifications. There are var- ious areas of focus here, including durability, > recyclability, repairability and the energy and resource efficiency of appliances in real-world use. The aim is to always offer the all-round best appliance on the market. The company works on this in close > dialogue with con- sumers, suppliers and further partners from the industrial and research sectors and from associations. Miele also focuses on coopera- tion when developing innovative new business models relating to sustainability, for example by working with partners such as start-ups. NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS [GRI 203-2] Miele advances numerous pro- jects with promising start-ups in fields such as the smart home, customer support, digital marketing and industry 4.0. Forms of coopera- tion range from joint development projects and management support to direct capital invest- ment. All of Miele\\u2019s involvement in emerging companies to support the traditional line of business takes place under the Miele Ven- ture Capital umbrella. As one example, Miele holds a stake in Plant Jammer, a Danish com- pany. The Plant Jammer app helps consumers use leftover foods creatively. Another example is KptnCook, a Berlin-based start-up that also offers an app having to do with food \\u2013 from indi- vidual recipe inspiration and shopping right up to the finished dish. MChef, based in the German city of Bielefeld, lets customers place online orders for gourmet dishes already plated on high-quality reusable crockery and prepare them conveniently in the Miele Dialog oven, with options for other oven models starting in 2021. Miele Operations & Payment Solutions, a wholly owned Miele subsidiary founded in 2019, developed the appWash concept for shared use of Miele washing machines and tumble dryers, including online reservations and cashless payment. The idea of using appWash to make it easier and more flexible to use and manage appliances provided centrally \\u2013 in larger apart- ment complexes or student housing, for example \\u2013 arose in the smart home area of expertise. The Miele Professional division also relies on partnerships. During the reporting period, a strategic alliance with the medical technology SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling 5.5% of total turnover is invested in research and development. company W&H was launched. Miele and W&H plan to align their product portfolios in the future, each of them incorporating machines from the other partner into its own range. For Miele, that means adding four new tabletop sterilisers from W&H to its product selection. In turn, the washer-disinfectors that W&H now offers come from the Miele plant in Bielefeld. RENTING INSTEAD OF BUYING [GRI 203-2] Under the \\u201cpay-per-use\\u201d model, customers only pay for individual units of output rather than buying an appliance. In the FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS case of a washing machine, for example, one wash cycle would constitute one unit of output. Studies suggest that a pay-per-use approach could promote sustainable con- sumption, not only raising users\\u2019 awareness of efficient use of energy and other resources, but also delivering possible financial savings. After all, someone who pays for each wash cycle is more likely to wait until they have enough laundry to make up a full load instead of running the machine half-empty. In the Netherlands, Miele has been offering a leasing service for washing machines since 2016. The service involves billing users on the basis of their actual use. The low-cost leasing model allows even price-conscious house- holds such as groups of flatmates to conserve resources by using high-quality, efficient appliances. Miele works with Bundles, another start-up, to offer the pro- gramme. When users terminate the leasing contract, the appliance is returned to Bundles and prepared for the next user. EFFICIENT SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Miele offers its customers more than simply high-performance domestic and commercial appliances \\u2013 it increasingly also offers them complete system solutions. These include the appliance itself, useful accessories, the right 2929  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality cleaning agents, smart control and dosing functions and tailor-made service options. Among other things, Miele washing machines and dishwashers are capable of using sensor data to dispense exactly the right amount of detergent. The TwinDos washing machine dosing function unlocks outstanding cleaning results when used with UltraPhase 1 and 2 detergents while also actively helping to pro- tect the environment. As a result, the machine uses only as much detergent as needed, > conserving resources. TwinDos, like the AutoDos function in dishwashers, also allows for smart inventory management, including convenient ordering of replacement supplies of cleaning products via the Miele app (for- merly the Miele@mobile app). For commercial machines, Miele offers cleaning agents under the ProCare brand, also in combina- tion with resource-efficient automatic dosing. Hygiene products are another business segment where Miele offers system solutions. The Professional Business Unit offers facilities such as hotels, nursing homes and medical practices a wide range of system solutions for cleaning and disinfecting crockery, cutlery and instruments. Miele washer-disinfectors and sterilisers process instruments efficiently and safely while also minimising wear and ensuring that they retain their value. If a machine needs service, Miele medical product technicians travel to the site within 24 hours to quickly find a solution. Beyond that, Miele advises business customers on the cost-effective use of efficient washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers in shared facilities such as utility rooms or employee kitchenettes. Miele also offers convenient system solutions in the coffee preparation segment. Depending on the model, coffee machines from Miele feature automatic cleaning and descaling functions for which Miele offers special cartridges. This ensures efficient cleaning, which in turn contributes to the durability of the product. There are also a number of Miele coffee blends available. The coffee is certified fair trade and organic. CONNECTING DOMESTIC APPLIANCES Miele is a leading provider when it comes to connecting domestic appliances. Under the \\u201cMiele@home\\u201d category, the company carries more than 700 different domestic appliance versions with connectivity capa- bility worldwide as part of its portfolio. These appliances revolutionise operation and offer customers added benefits through increased flexibility, convenience, quality of life and > security. Miele created the Smart Home area of expertise in 2017 to serve as a home for all its expertise in this field and drive fur- ther advances in connectivity. The company also founded a subsidiary called Miele Venture Capital, which invests in innovative start-ups. Connected systems already make running a household energy-efficient, secure and convenient. For example, domestic appli- ances can also be controlled conveniently using Amazon\\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assis- tant. Miele customers can use this function to get information about their appliances\\u2019 operating status, control them using voice commands or get explanations of features. New machines, languages and expertise SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION Customer orientation and information EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Disposal and recycling FRESH-PICKED SALAD AND HERBS FROM THE PLANTCUBE Miele entered the vertical farming segment in 2019 with the newly created New Growth Factory Business Unit. \\u201cVertical farming\\u201d is the futuristic term used by researchers for multistorey greenhouses designed to grow food in a compact form close to where it is needed, such as in urban centres. The Plantcube from the Miele subsidiary Agri- lution brings this revolutionary concept home. The fully automated cabinet-style greenhouse is no larger than a standard refrigerator and offers perfect conditions for growing salad, herbs and microgreens \\u2013 seedlings har- vested after just a few days of growth so that they are especially flavourful and rich in nutrients. Growing food this way takes minimal effort, and the harvest is free of pesticides and other environmental influences.

MEASURES TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT in each phase of the product life cycle Connectivity is increasingly unlocking new application scenarios that bring fur- ther advantages in terms of sustainability. Washing assistants integrated into the Miele app provide information on particularly energy-efficient appliance cycles, for example. The AddLoad feature makes it possible to add laundry items that were inadver- tently left out to a load in progress without having to restart the cycle. AddLoad is dis- played on the machine itself and in the Miele app. This lets users see whether it is pos- sible to add laundry to the washing machine, and if so until when, even from a distance. Product development Achievement of the best energy efficiency classes Production Environmental and energy management Use of the optimal technology1) Avoidance of critical substances Consideration of stakeholder requirements In a smart home, appliances from different manufacturers and product categories have to be able to communicate and interact with each other. To accommodate this need, Miele offers an open interface that can be used to integrate Miele@home devices into cross-manufacturer systems and plat- forms. This enables the use of base functions such as start/stop and checking machine status. To drive further advances in com- patibility and interoperability beyond that, Miele is involved in the > EEBus Initiative and > CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization. The goal of these alliances is to establish common standards in electrotechnical areas and for intelligent energy management. The company also tests the interoperability of connected domestic appliances and other building technology components in projects that receive national and international funding. Material selection targets the use of secondary raw materials and high recyclability and therefore high resource efficiency.

In 2018, the com- pany also launched a way for them to use the app to control multiple machines simultane- ously and order replacement detergents. The app provides information on machine status and sends a signal when detergent is run- ning low. MielePro@mobile is now available in six countries, enabling intelligent connec- tivity for Miele ProfiLine dishwashers as well as washing machines and tumble dryers in the > Little Giants model series. The Miele portfolio currently encompasses over 100 commercial machines with connectivity capa- bility that can be linked using the mobile app. Miele offers a remote maintenance function for connected machines to handle software updates that may be necessary. Available updates can be downloaded and installed on the machine in question remotely if the cus- tomer wishes. Starting in 2021, Miele offers users of its premium ovens the ability to pur- chase additional applications and configure them individually, initially limited to Den- mark as a pilot market. These include the Smart Food ID and Smart Browning Control functions, which use cameras to deter- mine food status inside the oven, followed by preparation using automatic programmes. Remote updates make it possible to equip these kinds of Miele appliances with new applications even after years of use. DIGITAL MANAGEMENT FOR COMMERCIAL MACHINES The MielePro@mobile app lets commer- cial customers access their machines from Miele created the Smart Home Professional unit in 2019 to focus on digital innovation management in the commercial solution seg- ment. Smart Home Professional operates the Miele MOVE platform for the company\\u2019s consumers, giving them a source for digital solutions from Miele Professional. Commer- cial users can also visit the platform for a wide range of digital services across different machines to support their day-to-day work. DESIGN Miele\\u2019s design philosophy encompasses ele- gance and aesthetics alongside intuitive, self-explanatory and accessible handling geared towards the needs of all customers. Accordingly, demographic change in indus- trialised nations has already been a key focus for Miele product development for some time. Right from the development of its appliances, the company takes care to ensure that they are easy to use regardless of the user\\u2019s age or physical capabilities. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling This has been a demonstrable success with the KM 7897 FL induction hob, for example. The system automatically recognises the pots and pans placed on the hob, along with changes in position, and adjusts the heat dis- tribution accordingly. The hob received the prestigious iF Design Award and > iF Gold Award 2020 for its easy and intuitive use. The aim of Miele\\u2019s product development activities is to reduce the complexity which people face in everyday life and to ensure that no one is excluded by applying a con- sistent design to all appliances in one product group and using a universal oper- ating logic. The technical term for this is \\u201cuniversal design\\u201d or \\u201cdesign for all\\u201d. Because design is also intended to encourage users to increase their use of the ECO functions to conserve energy and resources, Miele is careful to offer functions that users perceive as helpful and relevant and are happy to use. Specifically, the goal here is to use positive experiences to create a good feeling, solidi- fying sensible user behaviour and achieving the utmost in customer satisfaction. UNIVERSAL DESIGN [GRI 203-2] The rules of universal design ensure that the following performance charac- teristics are incorporated: broad usability, flexibility, simple and intuitive handling, sensory perception of information, fault tolerance, minimum physical effort, convenience and accessibility. Internal guidelines such as the Miele Ergo- nomic Index and the Haptics Guideline form FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS the basis for product design at Miele that has been optimised for ergonomics appeal to the sense of touch. The company aims to make using Miele domestic appliances possible even for the visually impaired. The Miele W1 Guideline, launched in 2017, is the only washing machine on the market that can be retrofitted to allow people with impaired or no vision to operate it. The standard version of this model also offers easy and intuitive use for all users. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST Miele always optimises existing products and develops new ones in keeping with legal requirements and in line with its own stan- dards that go beyond what is required by law. For example, the company also ful- fils the EU-wide Ecodesign Directive, which was revised during the reporting period. This directive on automatic washing machines and washer dryers, for example, sets specific requirements for manufacturers of prod- ucts like washing machines and their washing and rinsing functions. These specifications, which address aspects such as energy effi- ciency, will take effect by stages. Lawmakers have also stipulated repairability requirements to ensure that consumers have the option of obtaining repairs, thereby making it possible to use machines for longer. Producers like Miele are required to provide certain replace- ment parts for seven or ten years, depending on the product and target group, for example. The requirements took effect in March 2021 for the product categories of washing machines, 3232  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality washer-dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators, with further domestic appliances to follow. In order to keep all the key aspects in mind from pre-development to series maturity, Miele works with its in-house IMNU 2.0 product development system. Part of this system is the environmental checklist. It supports development projects with guidelines that show areas of focus that would make sense from an environmental stand- point. The environmental checklist also includes Miele-specific requirements for environmental design, repairability and packaging materials, as well as material specifications relating to things like the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons (PAHs), plasticisers or recycled plastics. These requirements go beyond the legal stipula- tions on the use of chemicals. Another element of the product development system is an inter- national digital rights registry, which provides information on the various legal require- ments that apply to machine development and makes it possible to keep these in mind on a country-specific and product-specific basis. Miele also develops scenarios for individual product categories that make it possible to sys- tematically analyse and regularly review trends and likely developments, including in the context of sustainability. In order to integrate sustain- ability aspects into the product development process right from the start, Miele also pro- duces corresponding life cycle assessments for relevant technological modifications. DIALOGUE FOR SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS [GRI 102-43] Cooperation shortens the path to success, which is why extensive dialogue is especially important to Miele. Various Miele departments and external part- ners work hand in hand during the product development process: The Design Center, marketing and market research teams pinpoint > customer needs, analyse the potential for improving existing appliances and machines and assess the prospects for new products. Designers and developers devote themselves to ideas and concepts. The toolshop, prefabrication and assembly areas cooperate closely with suppliers right from the early phases of development. Employees themselves also frequently supply valuable impetus for lasting improvements. In addition to the corporate suggestion scheme, which was rebranded > \\u201cIdee M\\u201d in 2018, Miele provides employees at many locations with GO IDEA, a database-driven ideas platform. The platform was intro- duced at the G\\u00fctersloh production plant for what is now the Laundry Business Unit in 2015 and later adopted in the Cooking, Small Domestic Appliances and Profes- sional Business Units as well. There are also idea scouts for the various product segments who work on idea develop- ment, manage the decision-making process through a committee and keep employees abreast of new ideas and activities. Supplier expertise is highly sought after, especially when new materials or the chal- lenging field of electromechanics are involved. Regular product innovation workshops held jointly with suppliers help to identify issues that could impact quality early on. External dialogue also contributes to taking future SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION Customer orientation and information EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Disposal and recycling HYGIENICALLY CLEAN LAUNDRY \\u2013 SCIENTIFI CALLY CONFIRMED It all started with a suggestion on the GO IDEA idea platform, which was scientifically reviewed in 2020. The result: certain Miele washing machines eliminate more than 99.9 percent of possible viruses from laundry. This was proven for models with automatic dosing and the \\u201cCotton Hygiene 60\\u00b0C\\u201d cycle as well as the extra \\u201cAllergoWash\\u201d.

With this in mind, Miele engages in regular dialogue with further interest groups and expert part- ners, such as the Oeko-Institut Freiburg. TOGETHER AGAINST MICROPLASTICS istry of Education and Research, which involved representatives of industry, the research sector and environmental asso- ciations. The project focused in particular on solutions in the areas of textile produc- tion and waste water treatment technology that looked at different stages of the tex- tile production chain and life cycle. Miele has watched closely and responded as public discussion surrounding the harmful global environmental impacts of plastic has surged in recent years. One area of special concern here is microplastics (tiny plastic particles and fibres with a diameter of less than 5 millimetres). This subject is espe- cially relevant to Miele, as microplastics can also enter the environment during washing, when they are released from clothing into the waste water system. From there, microplas- tics can find their way into the food chain and be consumed by humans, posing a health risk. Miele has been researching how to prevent or at least sharply reduce microplastics in suds for some time now. Miele washing machines themselves already make a significant contribution towards this aim. Specially designed honeycomb drums and adapted washing programmes handle clothing gently, minimising fibre abrasion. Pre-treatment of fabrics by the textile man- ufacturer offers great potential for reducing microplastics. Filter technologies in washing machines could also help, but economi- cally efficient use of filters is not possible with current technologies. To come up with further solutions, Miele partici- pated in the TextileMission joint research project funded by the German Federal Min- CUSTOMER NEEDS AND FUTURE SCENARIOS [GRI 102-43/-44] Miele market research has been conducting customer and satisfaction surveys in Germany and many other countries for over 30 years. As a result, it receives more than 250,000 consumer opinions every year from across the globe. Miele mines these for informative findings on market perception, pur- chasing decisions and user behaviour. Miele also works in cooperation with national and international market research institutes such as GfK to ensure that its product development activities are conducted on a firm footing. Direct contact with consumers is an integral part of the work done by Miele designers. At the G\\u00fctersloh site, for example, Miele has its own test studio which is used to perform us - ability tests. Here, a representative selection of consumers is given the opportunity to exten- sively test new domestic appliances. Working with consumer associations is another impor- tant factor. For example, Miele development teams work closely with the German Fed- eration of the Blind and Partially Sighted to design accessible products. They also develop future scenarios based on trend analyses, user models and the latest user experience (UX) methods, as well as observations and SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling surveys. These scenarios help the company identify the needs of tomorrow early on and address them in its development activities. Together with other companies that do research, Miele crafts visions of a digitalised and more sustainable life. Toward this aim, Miele Smart Home teamed up with Z_Punkt and the architecture firm Graft in early 2020 to launch the > FuturePIX initiative. In cooperation with further companies, two workshops have been held to develop an initial shared image of urban space in Europe for the year 2030. The initiative aims to combine the expertise of the various participating companies to assess the changes that are on the horizon for people\\u2019s living environments and use this as a source of insight for corporate strategies, new business segments and lines of business for participating stakeholders. During the reporting period, Miele also worked on innovative solutions for its own processes. These activities focused on the digital transformation of customer service, with customers\\u2019 possible future expectations as one area of analysis. Over 30 years of Miele market research FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 3434  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality Long service life, low consumption From day one, the core of the Miele product philosophy has been to offer its customers products of exceptional quality and with a particularly long service life. As a com- pany focused on sustainability, Miele also pays great attention to energy effi- ciency. More than three-quarters of the energy that domestic and commercial appliances need from development to dis- posal is consumed during the > usage phase. Miele adopts a holistic approach here too. In addition to energy demand, water consumption and the use of chemi- cals such as detergents also play a major role in relation to potential conservation. All Miele appliances are designed with maximum efficiency in mind under real conditions. For example, they feature a range of > consumption-reducing functions. Addi- tional potential for conserving resources is opened up by connectivity and incorporation into smart home concepts. In this process, Miele makes sure that low consumption does not come at the expense of practical benefit \\u2013 for example with respect to programme duration, > noise levels and the results achieved when cooking, cleaning, washing and vacuuming. ENERGY LABEL REFORM During the reporting period, the compa- ny\\u2019s areas of focus included the > reform of the energy label and providing associ- ated > information to customers. The new EU product label is intended to help con- sumers purchase energy-efficient large domestic appliances. A revised scale from A to G \\u2013 which initially applies to washing machines, washer-dryers, dishwashers, refrig- erators and freezers and wine storage units \\u2013 has been in effect since 1 March 2021. The previous A+++, A++ and A+ classes have been eliminated. Beyond that, more-realistic methods of measuring energy consump- tion and determining the label class were introduced in some areas. The new legis- lation was specifically drafted to ensure that few products, if any, are assigned to the highest label classes for some time to come. Because new calculation methods were applied, the old scale and the new one are not comparable. For example, refrigerators and freezers that previously fell within the old labelling scheme\\u2019s most efficient classes, from A+++ to A, may now be rated C to F, even with no change in energy consumption.

WASHING MACHINES [GRI 302-5] In the business year 2020, all Miele washing machines sold in the EU fell within what was then the best energy label class, A+++. Beyond that, the proportion of washing machines that consume at least 10 percent less energy than is required to be included in the best energy efficiency class (depending on the model) has increased significantly in recent years. The figure stood at 82 percent in the business year 2020 (2019: 72 percent). Under the energy label requirements that took effect in March 2021, almost all front loader models are rated for the new best energy effi- ciency class, A, thanks to their innovative, highly efficient technology. The only model to come in second best, with a B rating, is the entry-level model with a load capacity of 7 kilogrammes. Top loaders fall in energy efficiency class C. Miele systematically develops its domestic and commercial appliances further by giving consider- ation to the entire product life cycle. As the scope for achieving further improvements in efficiency is getting smaller and smaller, the need for smart solutions is high. For this reason, Miele introduced the SingleWash programme in 2018. This pro- gramme improves the environmental performance of the washing machines when a very light load is used. Unfortunately, light loads are becoming more and more common in daily life, previously resulting in high energy demands. By using this programme, the washing machine uses 60 percent less energy and 51 percent less water compared with conventional automatic load detection. In addition, the cycle is also reduced by 59 percent. Some Miele household models even offer an addi- tional connection for hot water, rain or well water. Using solar-heated hot water, for example, makes it possible to reduce electricity consumption by a further 35 percent compared to the use of cold tap water. The new Little Giants commercial model series introduced in early 2019 includes washing machines and tumble dryers that use as much as 22 percent less water and 28 percent less elec- tricity compared with the previous generation. 100% of Miele washing machines sold in 2020 reach the highest efficiency class available on the market. Washing machine operation is continuously being adjusted to reflect customers\\u2019 current needs and requirements. The large M Touch user interface is as intuitive, easy and quick to use as a smart- phone. The white script on black background that is typical of Miele appliances is also highly legible. The size of the touch display also contributes to ease of handling.

Since washer dryers are frequently used for washing alone, the new label has two parts. testing by Stiftung Warentest (tested 09/2020). It was the only model to earn the highest rating of \\u201cexcellent\\u201d, putting it well ahead of the sec- ond-ranked contender. The Miele appliance stood out from the rest in the testing criteria of drying, handling and environmental properties in particular. The new Little Giants commer- cial tumble dryer generation also includes a model featuring heat pump technology. All Miele washer dryers have the highest energy efficiency rating, A, for their wash cycles. That is true of both the old energy label and the new one. The washing and drying programme achieves energy efficiency class D under the new labelling scheme. TUMBLE DRYERS [GRI 302-5] In the case of tumble dryers, the percentage of appliances with the previous best energy efficiency rating, A+++, rose signif- icantly in the reporting period, from 52 percent in 2019 to 59 percent in 2020. The fact that the particularly efficient heat pump technology has been introduced onto the market played a crucial role in this. Thanks to further techno- logical developments, the new top model \\u201cT1 Passion\\u201d surpassed the limit value of A+++ by 10 percent. The EcoDry technology with particularly effective filter system and mainte- nance-free heat exchanger ensures low energy consumption and short drying times on a long- term basis. The shift to R290 refrigerant also marks a big step forward in moving toward a tumble dryer range without chlorofluorocar- bons. Seventy-six percent of the tumble dryers with heat pump sold in Europe in 2020 were already equipped with this climate-friendlier refrigerant. In 2020, the Miele heat pump tumble dryer TEB 155 WP emerged the only winner in DISHWASHERS [GRI 302-5] Miele introduced the G 7000 series back in 2018. Its AutoDos system with inte- grated PowerDisk dispenses the detergent according to the programme selected or \\u2013 in automatic mode \\u2013 according to the level of dirt. This makes cleaning particularly efficient as overdosing of detergent is prevented. Fur- ther refinements were also made in mobile > control via app for greater convenience and ease. In some countries, Amazon\\u2019s voice assis- tant > Alexa is also available for this purpose. This means that customers can, for example, start and stop their dishwasher from anywhere, check fill levels or order detergent online. In all, the percentage of dishwashers with the previous best energy efficiency rating rose during the reporting period, climbing from 44 percent in 2019 to 51 percent in 2020. Miele launched the new generation of under-countertop tank dishwashers in the PTD 70x model series during the reporting period for superior efficiency in profes- sional dishwashing applications. The narrow glass cleaning model in particular is much more resource-efficient, with standard pro- SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling grammes using just 2 litres of water to rinse and the Eco programme lowering the figure still further, to 1.8 litres. This represents a saving of 17 and 25 percent, respectively, over the previous generation. The other three models in this series use 8 to 17 percent less water. This is achieved through opti- mised water routing and redesigned spray arms. Because the system uses less water, it also needs less energy and detergent. VACUUM CLEANERS [GRI 302-5] Since 2017, the Ecodesign Reg- ulation for Vacuum Cleaners has restricted the power of vacuum cleaners to a max- imum of 900 watts and placed higher demands on dust suction and noise reduc- tion. At the heart of the Miele vacuum cleaner is a highly efficient fan with up to 25 percent better effectiveness than its pre- decessor. Together with various > appliance optimisations and appropriate accesso- ries, such as the fine dust Miele HyClean 3D Efficiency dustbag, this fan ensures the cleaning performance is constantly high with significantly lower energy consumption. Efficient floorheads also play an impor- tant role here, as they can achieve top-class cleaning results even with low wattage and low power settings. Vacuum cleaners with EcoTeQ floorheads made up 17 percent of those sold in the EU in 2020. The high per- formance capacity of these machines with 550 watts has also been confirmed by testing institutes. In early 2021, Stiftung Warentest named a model from the EcoLine series (550 watts) the winner in its test, with the top mark of 2.0 (tested 02/2021).

Beyond that, many Miele appliances are equipped with a range of functions and fea- tures that allow users to tap into further potential for savings. ECO FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES APPLIANCES AND FEATURES How it works EcoFeedback (dishwashers) With the EcoFeedback function, users have the current consumption values of their dishwasher under control. Even before the cycle starts, they receive a forecast on the water and electricity consumption for the select- ed programme. They can therefore find out at a glance, for example, that a programme operating at a longer cycle time or lower temperature will require less energy. At the end of the programme, the appliance displays the actual consumption in kilowatt-hours and litres.

All programmes and functions undergo continuous improvement to reduce consumption and achieve superior efficiency in real-world use. 3939  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality and research confirm that this is also worth- while from an ecological perspective (> UBA 2016, > \\u00d6ko-Institut 2015, > \\u00d6ko-Institut 2018). 5,600 programme cycles is what a Miele dishwasher must deliver during testing. DURABILITY: ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL PRODUCT SERVICE LIFE MIELE APPLIANCES REMAIN A PART OF THE HOME FOR LONGER In order to benefit from the ecological advan- tages of durability, however, the appliances must be used by consumers for long enough. In fact, Miele domestic appliances are used in the home for longer than appliances from other manufacturers before they are either sold on or replaced due to a defect. This has been repeat- edly confirmed in several studies in the past. In a survey, Stiftung Warentest discovered that users of Miele tumble dryers mentioned rel- atively few issues and faults compared with competitor products, even with appliances as old as 20 years or more (tested 09/2018). Miele is the only manufacturer in the industry that tests its products to last up to 20 years. The requirements that appliances must sat- isfy in these tests are defined in a separate plant standard. For washing machines and washer dryers for household use, Miele assumes five programme cycles a week, or 5,000 over 20 years. Commercial machines also undergo service life testing. For example, Miele calculates two programme cycles per day for cleaning and disinfection devices in the PG 85 series, which works out to more than 15,000 hours of operation over 20 years. This exceptional durability of Miele prod- ucts is the result of sturdy construction, the use of high-quality materials and demanding load and endurance tests. Various surveys Customer satisfaction is a factor that is not to be underestimated when it comes to ensuring that domestic appliances are used for as long as possible. If a domestic appliance does its job reliably and delivers the results, user con- venience, energy efficiency and design that customers ask for, a functioning appliance will very rarely be replaced early. As a result, key tasks for product development activities at Miele include > timeless design, good repairability and the ability to update control software to the latest version later on. The current brand loyalty con- firms the success of this strategy. According to Stiftung Warentest, more than 70 percent of people who use a Miele washing machine or tumble dryer would opt for a Miele appliance again. More than 77 percent would \\u201cdefinitely\\u201d recommend Miele tumble dryers (test 04/2018). SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling NEW SOFTWARE FOR OLDER APPLIANCES The increasing importance of software in domestic appliances offers the oppor- tunity to improve functions over the long utilisation phase of Miele appliances or to adapt them to new requirements. Thanks to standardised diagnostic support from authorised Miele service partners, soft- ware improvements can be installed not just on new appliances, but also on those that have already been produced. The company also introduced a remote main- tenance function in 2020, which has already made it possible to optimise or expand the software in domestic appliances in many countries around the world from a distance. GOOD REPAIRABILITY Miele domestic appliances are renowned for their reliability. Nevertheless, over the course of a long appliance life, faults may occur that require the assistance of the service team. In order to keep customer costs low in such cases, the appliances are designed to be \\u201crepair-friendly\\u201d. This means that as little effort as possible should be required to repair or replace a component. As Miele assumes a service life of up to 20 years for its products, its supply of spare parts is organised gener- ously. Around 70,000 different original Miele spare parts are therefore permanently held in stock at the central warehouse in G\\u00fcter- sloh. From there, they are then dispatched as required to locations all over the world and are available for many years after produc- tion of the particular appliance has ceased. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS GENTLE TREATMENT OF TEXTILES AND CROCKERY Durability in the broader sense of the word also includes the gentle treatment of textiles and the care of valuable cutlery and crockery in the dishwasher. In the case of washing machines, shorter programme durations, for example, protect the laundry and extend the life of the garments. Special detergents can also extend the life span of products. With this in mind, Miele introduced process chem- icals that are especially gentle on materials in its ProCare series during the reporting period. These phosphate-free, microplastic-free prod- ucts for commercial dishwashers and washing machines carry the EU Ecolabel. This seal of quality is used for products and services that are more ecofriendly than standard products. PRODUCT SAFETY: EXTENSIVE TESTING [GRI 416-1] As a general rule, all Miele prod- ucts are extensively tested with respect to health and safety risks to the consumer. Compliance with product safety aspects is tested and certified by independent bodies such as VDE, DEKRA or T\\u00dcV, and the prod- ucts are certified accordingly. In addition to laws and standards, in-house Miele stand- ards apply in certain areas, and in some cases have significantly more stringent requirements with respect to product safety. Extensive tests and service life inspec- tions also contribute to product safety as do findings from customer service callouts. In an industry comparison, Miele achieves a very high level of vertical integration of up to 50 percent depending on the product. This 4040  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Product portfolio and quality helps the company to differentiate the core components from the competition, strongly influencing the quality of these components, and therefore also enhancing product safety. Ensuring product safety is also a process that involves several areas, as Corporate Regu- latory Affairs (SRA), the design/development departments and Quality Management all work in close cooperation with each other. Certain sources of faults are carefully identified and assessed using targeted, global market mon- itoring, customer service feedback, product recalls, or spare parts sales (field monitoring). Influences from modified user behaviour can also be identified in this way. An additional factor is preventive quality work, which accompanies new products as early as the product develop- ment phase with the aid of test series and can therefore have an influence at an early stage. 70,000 spare parts are kept in stock up to 15 years after production of the particular appliance series. the countries where the products are distrib- uted. For example, this includes the full and reproducible documentation of each individual batch of sterile products as a matter of course. MEETING HIGH HYGIENE STANDARDS Miele\\u2019s professional commercial laundry appli- ances offer special programmes to suit the particular hygiene requirements of establish- ments such as retirement homes, hospitals or hotels. The same is true of fresh water com- mercial dishwashers, which meet significantly higher hygiene standards than models with a tank system, as fresh water is used for each rinse cycle. They also offer special programmes with high final rinse temperatures (up to more than 93\\u00b0C) and long temperature holding times. This combination of high temperatures and long holding times produces particularly hygienic cleaning results. The hygiene requirements in the medical technology sector are even higher. As a certified medical product manufacturer, Miele meets all statutory hygiene standards of A new series of CUBE-X sterilisers available since autumn 2019 offers processes that meet par- ticularly stringent hygiene standards for various loads, such as hollow medical instruments used in settings such as dentists\\u2019 offices. These prod- ucts do not require maintenance until five years or 4,000 cycles into their service life \\u2013 much later than comparable devices from competitors. In addition, Miele launched the Miele AirCon- trol air purifier series on the market in January 2021. These machines filter all of the air in a room up to 200 square meters in size six times an hour, using five levels of filtration to trap floating particles, viruses, bacteria and mould. The air purifiers are especially suitable for use in meeting rooms, childcare facili- ties, classrooms and retail outlets. When used in tandem with other hygiene measures, they can help to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling STRICT STANDARDS FOR POLLUTANT-FREE PRODUCTS [GRI 102-11] As a matter of principle, Miele avoids the use of critical substances, wher- ever possible. Before any substances are used, Miele establishes whether they are considered critical by experts, and whether there are reasons to avoid them relating to the environment and/or human health. To this end, the use of critical substances is restricted by specifications that apply throughout the company, such as Miele\\u2019s own company standards. Compliance with rel- evant legal standards is second nature to Miele. Such standards include, for example, the EU chemicals regulation (REACH) and the EU directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances (RoHS). Compliance is monitored through analysis of products and components. EMISSIONS AND INDOOR CLIMATE Miele appliances are optimised in every conceiv- able way so that emissions like noise, odours and moisture are also kept to a minimum. For example, Miele dishwashers and cooker hoods are among the quietest products on the market. Even in open-plan kitchens, the operating noises are not regarded as a nuisance. Another advantage of this is that dishwashers, for example, can be operated outside of electricity peaks and at off-peak tariffs, where applicable. Miele tumble dryers operate highly efficiently and produce the lowest condensate losses compared with competitor products. As a result, they release a particularly low amount FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS of moisture into the ambient air. This is advan- tageous both in terms of energy efficiency and for health reasons, as excessive air humidity can lead to mould formation in rooms without sufficient ventilation. During the cold winter months, however, ventilating indoor spaces results in significant heat loss, which can only be addressed by turning up the heat and thus using more energy. Miele cooker hoods and ovens are equipped with filters or catalysers (depending on the model for ovens) to min- imise odours while also preventing greasy vapours from entering the ambient air. Miele\\u2019s goal is to curb emissions in floor care as well, which is why Miele vacuum cleaners have multi-stage filtration systems. Depending on the model, examples include HEPA filters, which trap microscopic particles and allergens. Thanks to their sustainable properties, Miele machines were selected for a very special pro- ject in Denmark. Miele is a standard equipment provider involved in designing Denmark\\u2019s very first \\u201cgreen city\\u201d. Between now and 2024, sus- tainable housing and work space is being created in Copenhagen\\u2019s Carlsberg district. The G\\u00fctersloh-based manufacturer is sup- plying some 15,000 domestic appliances for the project, in which sustainability takes centre stage across every area of domestic life, from timeless design and carbon neutrality to the long life spans of Miele appliances. 4141  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Customer orientation and information Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Customer orientation and information Ensuring maximum customer satisfaction For Miele, meeting the expectations of its customers when it comes to products and services \\u2013 and even exceeding them where possible \\u2013 is of the utmost importance. Long-term partnerships with retailers are one important factor in this. Miele appliances are sold in Germany, Europe and abroad through authorised dealers and by Miele itself. The company uses this approach to ensure high quality when it comes to marketing as well. In 2020, Miele supplied over 12,500 author- ised dealers in Germany. These dealers adopt the same high demands for quality in terms of presentation, range of products and services, consultation skills and cus- tomer services. Miele and its partners apply the same standards in e-commerce as well. As sustainability is becoming increasingly important to consumers, Miele provides transparent information on the sustain- able design and use of its products. GROWING INTEREST IN SUSTAINABILITY [GRI 417-1/-2] In many countries, Miele is registering a growing interest in sus- tainability among customers, especially with respect to consumption. Efficiency values for electricity, water and gas have become a key argument when it comes to making decisions to purchase, as feed- back from dealers and customer surveys show. Miele uses various channels of communication to inform its customers about sustainability, including informa- tion provided on the product (EU energy consumption labelling), operating instruc- tions, product brochures and consultations with dealers and in showrooms around the world, as well as international trade fairs. Corporate communications and the com- pany website also contain information on sustainability aspects. Information on the proper > disposal and > safe operation of machines is prominently featured in various locations. Incorrect or inadequate infor- mation on this subject could have negative consequences for people and the environ- ment. Miele uses the Sustainability Report, for example, to report on matters such as where the components of its products come from and whether recycled materials are used. Communication about sustainability reaches customers, together with informa- tion about the good reputation of the Miele brand. In representative studies conducted by the Miele market research team from 2019 to the first quarter of 2021, the majority of the approximately 54,000 respon dents in 15 European countries confirmed that Miele supports a sustainable lifestyle. Over 12,500 authorised dealers for Miele domestic appliances and commercial machines FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS There were no relevant incidents of non-compliance with regulations or rules of conduct relating to product and service information and labelling during the reporting period. EXTENDED WARRANTIES AVAILABLE From material defects to manufacturing errors, Miele\\u2019s two-year manufacturer warranty means > repairs are free of charge for customers. For added peace of mind, customers can extend the war- ranty to five or ten years as long as it has not yet expired. Miele teamed up with an insurance partner in 2018 to offer an extended warranty service, pro- viding full coverage for appliances that are already out of warranty, where the extended warranty is expiring soon or that are already ten years old or more. The \\u201cMiele Service Zertifikat Plus\\u201d package comes with a monthly fee. This is one way Miele is doing its part to extend the period of application of its appliances and thereby conserve resources. The service has been very well received by customers, with over 25,000 contracts concluded in 2020 \\u2013 about 1,000 more than the previous year. 4242  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality AFTER-SALES CUSTOMER SERVICE Miele employs approximately 2,500 ser- vice technicians who regularly undergo rigorous training and complete their ser- vice calls with the help of extensively equipped service vans. The \\u201cfirst-call completion rate\\u201d (percentage of service requests complete after the first service call) for Miele Service is 80 to 85 per- cent globally. In Germany, a rate of over 90 percent has already been achieved. DETAILED CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR RECALL CAMPAIGNS [GRI 416-2] Despite Miele\\u2019s high quality standards, recall campaigns may become necessary in certain very rare instances. Detailed contingency plans are in place for this, with the names of the persons respon- sible for taking prompt action. Experiences from such recalls are thoroughly analysed and considered for future developments. There were no recall campaigns during the reporting period. VIRTUAL INTERIOR PLANNING It allows customers to see what \\u201ctheir\\u201d kitchen would look like in advance. Solutions like this one are mainly offered and promoted by kitchen design software manufacturers. SENSITIVE HANDLING OF CUSTOMER DATA [GRI 418-1] Miele views protecting the > Miele@home infrastructure and secure handling of customer data as extremely important. Trust in Miele must also be secured, even in an interconnected world. With this in mind, the company takes a whole host of precautions, utilises state- of-the-art encryption methods and works tirelessly in conjunction with external spe- cialists to make further improvements to the security architecture. In addition to the EU General Data Protection Regu- lation (GDPR), the Miele privacy policy, rolled out in 2018, sets out rules on han- dling of digital data, especially customer data. There were no substantiated com- plaints regarding data protection or privacy infringements among customers in the reporting period. There were also no cases of data theft or loss of customer data. The collection, storage, processing and use of all personal customer data are per- formed according to data protection rules. Many people would like to plan and deco- rate their household individually and consider vari ous options as quickly, realistically and easily as possible. As a result, Miele is increasingly focusing on digital presentation and planning for various product configu- rations and providing the necessary data for them to do so. Virtual reality is increas- ingly important in the visualisation of kitchen designs at kitchen and furniture stores.

CARE TIPS FOR LONG APPLIANCE LIFE Miele appliances are known for their superior durability and reliability. But even high-quality products require proper care \\u2013 something that could help to avoid some service cases. In France, Miele launched a campaign on this topic. The campaign included a brochure containing care tips, information at retail locations (via QR codes, for example) and online tutorials on social media. The dura- bility and repairability of domestic appliances are viewed as very important in France. As a result, the campaign generated a very positive response and will be continued. CONTENTS 4343  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality AWARDS FOR QUALITY AND SERVICE Various awards repeatedly confirm the reliability of Miele\\u2019s appliances and customer service. These include the following from the reporting period: At the Domestic Appliance Awards organised by the consultancy firm Kantar, Miele received top marks in the cate- gory of customer satisfaction in 2019 across all the markets studied (Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Spain) and across all product categories.

FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 4444  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality Disposal and recycling Environmentally responsible treatment of old appliances Once a Miele product reaches the end of its typical long useful life, the next step is to send it for recycling or for further disposal via a return system. This is why Miele actively works on continuously improving the return systems. The company\\u2019s special focus here is on the areas of logistics and protecting the environment. Miele also engages with con- sumers in particular through various channels, initiatives and campaigns, sharing informa- tion on how to properly return old appliances for environmentally responsible disposal. FURTHER ENHANCING RECYCLABILITY Making sure an appliance is recyclable down the line is a factor as early as during > product development. For example, Miele works with waste management compa- nies and operators of treatment plants to study the potential effects on disposal or ini- tial treatment and recycling of appliances at the end of a product\\u2019s life. Both domestic and commercial appliances from Miele are characterised by a very high level of recy- clability. This is achieved through various means, including careful selection of mate- rials and bonding techniques. For example, the company is careful to use plastics of the same type frequently in order to make recy- cling easier or even possible in the first place. To facilitate disassembly and separation, the number of different material types and screw varieties is also kept to a minimum. Wherever it may be possible and practical without affecting quality, Miele investigates whether secondary or alternative, more recy- clable materials can be used. One important area is packaging for cleaning and care prod- ucts. Miele has the recyclability of some of its plastic packaging tested and assessed by external institutes. Experts from Miele and waste management companies also jointly conduct practical tests on selected packaging types to ensure that the materials used are easy to separate and then sort for recycling. In December 2019, Miele specialists visited a disposal partner in Porta Westfalica, Germany. While there, they discussed current topics in the field of packaging and took a guided tour of the sorting facility for lightweight pack- aging materials. The group was especially interested in the opportunity to see a spe- cial technology used to separate multilayer packages via near-infrared spectroscopy. CLOSING THE LOOP [GRI 301-2] In May 2018, the European Council adopted a circular economy package that has shaped development SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling and production activities at Miele to a sig- nificant degree since then. It includes changes in multiple waste-specific direc- tives, including for packaging, and has now been incorporated into many laws at the national level. It also makes possible fur- ther steps towards achieving a fully circular economy. Miele supports these plans and has implemented various projects to recycle components from old Miele appliances Miele is also increasingly focusing on circular models to boost the use of recycled and recyclable materials. The product category of vacuum cleaners and accessories offers one example. In 2020, the company began producing one brush, two heads and one dusting brush from post-consumer recycled plastic. This means the plastic was previ- ously used by consumers and then recycled. At the same time, the family-owned com- pany supports different projects aimed at promoting the circular economy. One of them is the WEEE-Harz project, which is receiving funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The pro- ject is studying how a sustainable circular economy for electrical appliances can be developed in Germany\\u2019s Harz region. Miele also began working with other producers FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS and stakeholders in the disposal industry in the Dialogforum effiziente Kreislaufwirtschaft (Efficient Circular Economy Dialogue Forum) in 2020 to help further improve the infor- mation system for efficient recycling. RESPONSIBLE RETURNS AND DISPOSAL [GRI 301-3] Throughout the world, Miele strives to ensure that its materials are recy- cled in an environmentally friendly manner along the entire waste management chain, and support the fight against illegal trade involving waste electrical appliances. In the EU, the return and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment is regu- lated by the WEEE Directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive). The Electrical and Electronic Equipment Act (ElektroG) transposes the provisions of the WEEE Directive into German law. The body in charge of its implementation is the German national register for waste electric equipment (known as stiftung ear). Among other things, it is responsible for registering manufac- turers, coordinating the provision of collection containers by manufacturers and arranging to pick up old appliances at transfer points set up by municipalities.

In other EU countries, Miele uses similar \\u2013 and in some cases state-run \\u2013 return and recycling systems, such as Recupel in Belgium, Eco-syst\\u00e8mes in France and UFH in Austria. Outside the EU, Miele makes use of the established disposal systems already in place. The \\u201cE-Waste Recycling\\u201d association is responsible for collecting and disposing of old electronics in Russia. It was founded by manufacturers in 2017 and has since devel- oped disposal standards and an audit system to monitor recycling companies. Beyond that, Miele also works on the fur- ther development and harmonization of disposal standards. For example, the com- pany participated in May 2020 in a workshop as part of the European Commission\\u2019s study on > quality standards for the treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Miele was also involved in the development of the EN 50614:2020 standard, published in 2020. This standard sets out uniform requirements for preparing to reuse waste electrical and electronic equipment. The goal is to ensure that it is possible to reuse appliances that are still usable or their com- ponents, even within the waste management regime itself. Across all of Miele\\u2019s activities in this area, the overarching goal is to ensure product safety for consumers while estab- lishing uniform competitive conditions and standards for the stakeholders involved. 4646  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality RETURNS OF OLD APPLIANCES [GRI 301-3] In Germany, the ElektroG (2015, amended in 2021) requires manufacturers, local authorities, brick-and-mortar dealers and online distributors with a sales area or storage/ dispatch area of 400 square metres or more to accept the return of old appliances. Miele offers to accept returns of old appliances of the same type when a new appliance is purchased online as well. Beyond that, small appliances with external dimensions of less than 25 cen- timetres can be returned free of charge, whether or not a new one is purchased. In cooperation with the return service provider WEEE Return, small appliances returned to Miele are handled and recycled properly. > Miele dealers are also important partners. When buying a new appliance, customers can state whether they would like to have the dealer dispose of the old one. When the new product is delivered, the dealer takes the registered old appliance and delivers it either to a municipal collection point or directly to initial handling and recycling. The quantities that have been taken back and disposed of by manufacturers via stiftung ear have continued to rise sharply over the past few years, from just under 80,000 pickups in 2018 to over 90,000 in 2020. The increase is likely due to the effects of the expanded scope of the law (open scope) and other trends, such as the shift towards battery-powered appli- ances and devices. Increased consumer purchasing power and an uptick in pri- vate domestic appliance disposal due to the Covid-19 pandemic may also be fac- tors here. The total return requirement for providers in the appliance categories/col- lection groups is calculated based on the quantities brought into circulation. In the 2020 calendar year, Miele accepted returns of more than 12,350 tonnes of old appli- ances in the relevant categories across Germany on instructions from stiftung ear. RECLAIMED PACKAGING [GRI 301-3] As part of its legal obliga- tions, Miele also ensures that packaging is reclaimed in Germany. In keeping with an industry solution developed by manufac- turers of domestic appliances and of kitchen furnishings and accessories, the company has transport packaging materials picked up and disposed of properly by a shared disposal service provider and its subcontrac- tors. Sales packaging and outer packaging, which typically constitutes waste after the appliances are used by customers, are col- lected in Germany via the \\u201cdual system\\u201d. Miele engages in dialogue on this point with waste management companies and recycling and environmental technology engineering companies to identify potential ways to improve the recyclability of its packaging. Annual package disposal activities give rise to greenhouse gas emissions by waste man- agement companies, which are offset by climate action projects. For the business year 2019, Miele\\u2019s partner offset 512 tonnes of CO2 equivalents in the transportation packaging segment, and the relevant emis- sion reduction certificates were retired. SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling Miele is working with experts to make packaging even more recyclable by design. POLLUTANTS DURING DISPOSAL [GRI 305-6/-7, 416-1] The aim of proper dis- posal is to make substances that carry health risks or are harmful to the environ- ment as innocuous as possible. One example of this type of pollutant involves refrigerants and insulants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs are multiple times > more harmful to the environment than CO2. FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Older refrigeration equipment, including refrigerators, often still contains CFCs. The law requires manufacturers to recover CFCs to the greatest extent possible at the dis- posal stage. Miele meets these obligations as part of a manufacturing consortium which includes its specialised service providers. The DIN EN 50625-2-3 standard and TS 50625-3-4 specifications are explicitly part of the contracts with waste management 4747  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Development and innovation Product portfolio and quality companies and also apply to participating subcontractors. The methods and treatment facilities involved, along with their opera- tors, are also subject to stringent permitting requirements and checks by supervisory authorities in Germany. Miele also partici- pates in joint external audits via a consortium of manufacturers and obligates its disposal service providers to undergo audits of their treatment facilities for refrigeration equip- ment by a research institution approved to perform this kind of testing. The double audit system means that each treatment facility undergoes an average of four audits a year. The audit process includes various esca- lation levels in case any deviations from the standards are found. Immediate meas- ures can often remedy any problems. In the case of critical deviations, the last resort is to halt deliveries to the facility in question until a subsequent audit has been performed and the necessary measures have been accepted by the testing body. Recycling facil- ities are also subject to regular leakproofing tests (100-device test under the German Technical Instructions on Air Quality Con- trol (TA Luft)) and 1,000-device performance tests. Facility operators are additionally required to perform checks of their own. and has negative consequences for the environment. Consumers also share in the responsibility for making it difficult to col- lect waste illegally. As a result, Miele helps its customers to dispose responsibly of old appliances and transport packaging by pro- viding information in the appliance operating instructions and on the > miele-website. In 2020, the company also participated in the Germany-wide > \\u201cPlan E\\u201d consumer infor- mation campaign organized by stiftung ear. This campaign aims to raise aware- ness among consumers of how to properly return old appliances. The sales subsidiary in India operates an e-waste initiative to raise customers\\u2019 awareness of environmentally responsible recycling of old appliances and build a recycling supply chain to handle these products. Other sales subsidiaries offer dis- counts on new products. In the United Arab Emirates, for instance, consumers received a discount in 2019 when purchasing a vacuum cleaner if they returned their old vacuum cleaner \\u2013 no matter the brand \\u2013 to Miele. DISPOSAL OF MATERIALS RAISING CONSUMER AWARENESS OF RETURNS OF OLD APPLIANCES [GRI 417-1] It is not uncommon for elec- trical and electronic devices to be collected and resold illegally, for example in street campaigns, without the appropriate per- mits. This undermines the importance of the proper disposal of hazardous substances [GRI 417-1] New products, too, are tested with a view to their future disposal. Particular attention is paid to insulation materials, which help to lower the energy consumed by refrig- erators. For example, the process of breaking down vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) can give rise to particulates, which could cause prob- lems at the recycling plants if disposal is not carried out properly and the exhaust system is not designed correctly. However, research carried out by the European home appli- ance trade association APPLiA (previously SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY Customer orientation and information Disposal and recycling Disposal and recycling known as CECED) showed that if the plants are adequately impermeable and the filter systems are appropriate, then operations should run without any notable problems. TRANSPARENT LABELLING [GRI 417-1] The manufacturers organized within > APPLiA support waste manage- ment companies in doing their jobs properly. With this goal in mind, they have drafted codes of conduct on \\u201cend of life\\u201d labelling of appliances that contain VIPs and those containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, with Miele participating in a committee role. These voluntary pledges call for standard- ised labelling on the back of refrigerators, among other points. This is intended to make it possible to identify critical insulation materials and refrigerants, optimising envi- ronmentally responsible disposal. APPLiA and DIGITALEUROPE also operate the > I4R online information platform (Informa- tion for Recyclers). This website provides waste management companies and other interested parties with recycling information for various types of appliance directly from the manufacturer, including information on hazardous substances and components.

PRODUCTS & SERVICES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS CONTENTS 4949  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Natural resources and materials Efficient use of resources It takes natural resources and materials from all over the world to produce Miele appliances, from stainless steel for washing machines to plastic granulate for vacuum cleaners and glass ceramics for hobs. By the time these items arrive at the Miele locations, they have already undergone a multitude of process steps. Different sustainability considera- tions apply to these upstream value creation stages, depending on the material. Many nat- ural resources are only available in limited supply, even though demand is rising around the world. As resources become scarcer as a result, long-term availability and supply secu- rity are becoming increasingly important and posing more and more of a challenge. Miele is rising to this challenge. The > efficient use of materials and respon- sible handling of natural resources are key objectives and have been a firm fix- ture of the Miele strategy for years. In addition, Miele places great value on making the origins of materials and resources clear. Miele carries out regular checks to ensure that its direct suppliers are complying with > environmental and social standards. Hotspot analysis is carried out for individual components as and when necessary, such as if certain ecological or social risks are sus- pected in the natural resources supply chain. The various life cycle phases of the compo- nent are investigated with regard to specific sustainability issues. Despite Miele\\u2019s exten- sive efforts in this regard, it is currently not possible for the company to ensure com- plete traceability of all materials, given the globalised procurement markets and complex supply chains. However, direct sup- pliers are contractually obliged to confirm to Miele that their upstream suppliers are asked to comply with SA8000 standards. USE OF RESOURCES AND MATERIALS [GRI 102-9, 301-1/2] Miele obtains raw mate- rials such as stainless steel or plastic granulate, as well as components such as hoses and ball bearings, to manufacture its products. Entire products such as refrigerators, automatic coffee machines or microwave ovens are also sup- plied by > external manufacturing partners in accordance with Miele\\u2019s specifications. In the business year 2020, Miele obtained materials, components and domestic appli- ances with a value of around EUR 1.6 billion (2019: EUR 1.8 billion) from other compa- nies, including manufacturing materials with a value of around EUR 1.2 billion. In the business year 2020, Miele used a total of 127,238 tonnes of raw mate- rials (2019: 122,510 tonnes). The majority of these were metals (85 percent) in the form of iron and non-ferrous metals, steel and steel alloys. Apart from metals, Miele\\u2019s other main raw material is plastic granulate (15 percent). The company also uses auxil- iary and operating materials such as paints and oils, as well as electronic components. USE OF RECYCLABLE AND REUSABLE MATERIAL Miele appliances already contain a high pro- portion of recyclable materials and secondary raw materials \\u2013 i.e. raw materials which have already undergone a recycling process. The aim is to make even more efficient use of resources and ensure that as many mate- rials as possible are reused, which is why Miele checks that all of its materials are suit- able for use in a > closed recycling loop. This is an area that can give rise to con- flicting objectives. Using composite materials, for example, can save on resources, but can also lead to problems further down the line when materials have to be separated for recycling. Furthermore, not every mate- rial that can be easily recycled satisfies Miele\\u2019s RAW MATERIALS USED in tonnes 2020 18,641 TOTAL 127,238 108,597 Metals Plastic granulate requirements in relation to quality, durability and performance. Miele carefully weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of each material in order to maximise resource effi- ciency without compromising on quality. CORRECTLY USING RECYCLED PLASTICS [GRI 301-2] Plastics are an important com- ponent in many domestic appliances, 50  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility including vacuum cleaner casings, deter- gent drawers or the panels of washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers. Miele is always on the lookout for solu- tions involving > recycled materials so as to reduce the consumption of primary raw materials in this area too. Integrating recy- cled plastics into product development and production is a time-consuming and com- plex process. For example, the plastic has to suit the design of the respective appli- ance and pass durability tests. It is therefore very difficult to implement such a pro- cess into a pre-existing appliance series. In the long term, the aim is to expand the use of recycled materials wher- ever product characteristics allow for it and without undermining quality. In 2019, Miele committed to increasing the volume of plastic recyclates it uses to up to 7,500 tonnes by 2025. This figure cur- rently stands at roughly 194 tonnes. One of the areas where Miele already uses plastic recyclates is in its vacuum cleaner cable rewind systems. Additional pro- duction processes will be adjusted in the next few years. Recyclates are to be used in components or accessories for other product groups in addition to vacuum cleaner accessories in the near future. Pilot projects are currently under way. Each specific application has the poten- tial for the use of hundreds of kilograms of recyclate \\u2013 or even several tonnes. In 2020, Miele stepped up its efforts to coor- dinate with recyclate manufacturers and looked into material quality and durability. HIGH PROPORTION OF RECYCLED METAL [GRI 301-2] Stainless steel is a hugely impor- tant resource to Miele and can be recycled to a large extent, which is why Miele explicitly wel- comes efforts from its suppliers to process the highest possible proportion of recycled stainless steel while maintaining consistent quality. However, this proportion is set by the supplier and can vary for economic and tech- nological reasons for which Miele cannot be held responsible. As an example, it may be the case that recycled metals are no longer offered on the market at the required quality. PACKAGING: TESTING ALTERNATIVES, REDUCING WEIGHT The packaging of Miele domestic appli- ances must be robust enough to withstand the weight of the products. Stable mate- rials such as solid wood, cardboard, plastic moulded parts made from expanded polysty- rene (EPS) and polyethylene films are used in packaging, minimising damage during trans- port, storage and handling. A project team is tasked with continuously reviewing alter- native packaging materials so that Miele can switch to more environmentally friendly solu- tions in the long term. The most important criteria in this regard are high packaging stand- ards (product safety and low weight) and the smallest possible environmental footprint. In the business year 2020, the propor- tion of packaging weight in relation to all appliances produced by Miele was 9 percent (2019: 9.2 percent). 203,678 t of appliances produced in 2020 SAFE CLEANING AND CARE PRODUCTS Miele is the only household appliance man- ufacturer to offer a broad range of care and cleaning products which are perfectly aligned with machines and programme cycles. These products ensure top-class results and help customers use the right amounts to suit the degree of soiling. The demands on product packaging are high, for example with respect to durability, temperature resistance, protec- tion against light and product safety. Products are sent from Germany to all four corners of the world and need to withstand not only the transport itself, but also the changing cli- mates they are exposed to, which is why they are almost always packaged in polypropylene. This plastic meets these requirements perfectly and also has solid environmental characteris- tics, as it can be fully recycled. In addition, the cleaning products are extremely concentrated to reduce the amount of packaging required. The lids on Miele Caps laundry care capsules have been made from recycled plastic since this year. Miele Caps are small capsules pro- viding accurate and economical dosing of special detergent. This example of recy- cled packaging is set to be the first of many. ENSURING SUPPLY SECURITY Resources, materials and components must be available at the right time, in plen- tiful supply and at top standards of quality in order for Miele to use them in a suit- able manner. Miele has integrated early warning indicators for supply security into its > supplier management system to ensure that this is the case. The indi- cators have been used since 2016 for around 1,500 suppliers, who together account for more than 80 percent of the total purchasing volume. These indicators make it possible for Miele to identify potential risks which might jeopardise supply security at an early stage. Miele uses a software solution to record various hazards such as forces of nature (for example earthquakes, floods) or political risks. This process takes into account both country-specific and geo- graphical risks, as well as supplier-related risks such as creditworthiness. Pre- ventative measures, such as putting raw materials into storage at the supplier\\u2019s premises, are taken as soon as a pos- sible gap in supplies becomes apparent. As resources become ever scarcer, the increasing use of > recycled materials is also helping to ensure the supply of nec- essary raw materials in the long term. 51  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Supplier management Fair partnership with high standards Miele demands a lot from its suppliers in terms of quality and performance, but it also expects them to comply with high social and eco- logical standards. At the same time, Miele also understands that these requirements must be economically viable for suppliers. The aim is to establish long-term business relationships shaped by fairness, trust and collaboration, something that often begins in the area of > product development. Miele is constantly optimising its supplier man- agement system and adapting it to changing conditions. By doing so, Miele ensures con- sistently high product quality and long-term > supply security, as well as compliance with the latest sustainability requirements. The new German Supply Chain Act will require certain companies to ensure that human rights are respected in their supply chains from 2023. Under current legislation, the following aspects are considered relevant risk areas: forced labour, child labour, discrimination, prohibi- tion of freedom of association and problematic employment and working conditions. Miele has drawn on independent bodies to analyse these risk areas at its suppliers since 2004 and within the scope of official > SA8000 certification since 2008. Suppliers are also contractually obliged to comply with the same duties of care. PROCUREMENT CONCEPT WITH A LOCAL FOCUS [GRI 204-1] Miele products are mainly produced in Germany and other Euro- pean countries; 84 percent of deliveries to Miele plants \\u2013 based on purchasing volume \\u2013 come from Europe. This, cou- pled with > optimised transport logistics and the bundling of goods flows, saves on transport costs and reduces trans- port-related CO2 emissions. Local procurement is particularly impor- tant to the plants in China and the Czech Republic due to their distance from the other manufacturing locations. Since opening, the new plant in Poland has also looked to pro- cure materials, including washing machine doors and lids and packaging, from the local region in order to minimise transportation. The Uni\\u010dov plant in the Czech Republic also procures its packaging materials locally. SUPPLY SECURITY DURING A CRISIS The Covid-19 pandemic had a signifi- cant impact on the supply situation within the supply chain in 2020. In China, supply chains returned to normality relatively quickly. Italy, where Miele procures compo- 84% of deliveries to Miele plants \\u2013 based on purchasing volume \\u2013 come from Europe. nents from over 150 suppliers, proved to be the greatest challenge. In spite of the crisis, Miele was able to successfully avert supply risks and run its fleet of lorries at max- imum capacity. However, issues continue to plague the entire industry when it comes to procuring certain goods, including elec- tronic components and steel from India. Miele does not expect the situation to nor- malise again until 2022 at the earliest. Miele continues to expand its supply chain with the aim of implementing a dual- sourcing strategy that will allow it to avoid any future supply bottlenecks in sim- ilar situations. Dual sourcing involves procuring goods from two independent suppliers to ensure supply security even if one supplier is > unable to deliver. SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT: CHECKING SUSTAINABILITY CRITERIA [GRI 308-2, 412-1, 414-2] Miele man- ages the selection of new suppliers and monitors existing suppliers with the aid of a comprehensive supplier manage- ment system. The system not only focuses on aspects such as supply availability, quality and price, it also checks compli- ance with Miele\\u2019s sustainability criteria. 52  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Compliance with > environmental, > social and economic sustainability criteria is monitored and verified several times over the course of a business relationship.

Registration Supplier self-assessment with query regarding sustainability criteria Update requested once a year SUSTAINABLE SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT Miele\\u2019s supplier management system is made up of six systematically intercon- nected elements (see diagram). It is based on material sustainability criteria and is adjusted to changing circumstances on an ongoing basis.

All suppliers, irrespec- tive of location, are required to submit a self-declaration regarding compliance with standardised sustainability requirements The self-declaration covers a number of areas, including certification, standards and additional employee-related issues, as well as compliance, prevention of cor- ruption, environmental management and climate action. The material group man- agers in Purchasing check whether the self-declarations are complete and plau- sible. In the event of non-compliance, the potential supplier is given the opportunity to implement the necessary corrective meas- ures within a reasonable amount of time and restore compliance with requirements. If this does not happen, Miele will not con- sider entering into a business relationship. 157 trained process auditors Before taking on a new manufacturing mate- rial supplier, a brief audit is carried out on site to assess compliance with process quality and sustainability standards. If Miele identifies non-conformities but feels that the supplier would otherwise be a useful partner, it works together with the supplier to find a solution. If there is no improvement, Miele blocks the applicant. Brief audits were performed online for the first time in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

These audits take place before production starts and while it is ongoing. Sustainability criteria are also mon- itored as part of these process audits. As at 31 December 2020, Miele had over 157 trained and active process auditors who con- ducted 90 internal and external audits in 2020. COMPLIANCE WITH SA8000 CRITERIA [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1] Miele places par- ticular emphasis on social standards. All of Miele\\u2019s suppliers worldwide must commit to complying with the following criteria within their own organisation in accordance with SA8000, an internationally recognised social standard, and must also monitor compli- ance on the part of their own suppliers: Ban on child labour Ban on forced or compulsory labour Health and safety in the workplace The right to freedom of associa- tion and collective bargaining Ban on discrimination Ban on disciplinary measures (in the standards on working hours Adherence to payment legislation Staff in the Purchasing department carry out a general risk classification for all sup- pliers on the basis of the SA8000 criteria. Suppliers are classified as low, medium or high risk depending on the country and the industry. There are only a small number of high-risk suppliers. Miele monitors these suppliers continuously and ensures that staff from the Purchasing department con- duct annual assessments, including by means of SA8000 audits. Any suspicions that standards have been violated trigger a multi-stage > escalation process. Miele revised its risk classification system in the reporting period and for the first time added a country risk component, which has been developed by the amfori Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). This country classification covers the above cri- teria of the SA8000 social standard in accordance with the BSCI code. Clas- sifying country risk is aimed at helping companies to better identify potential social risks in connection with their pro- curement markets. This external instrument based on an independent database is a practical addition to Miele\\u2019s risk classifica- tion system. Any discrepancies between Miele\\u2019s risk classification and the country risk classification of amfori BSCI must be sense of physical punishment, mental 54  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility justified, explained and reviewed within the scope of an external SA8000 audit. In addition to the criteria based on SA8000, Miele requires its suppliers to provide information about which forms of employee participation the company has implemented and whether it has taken measures to ensure occupational health and safety and provide employees with additional training and support. ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL STANDARDS [GRI 308-1] As part of its efforts to main- tain ecological standards, Miele checks whether suppliers have implemented an environmental management system in line with standards such as ISO 14001, for example. The central supplier assessment system also includes information on whether the supplier uses resources in a sustain- able manner. Environmental requirements for materials and components are continu- ally adjusted to comply with the applicable legislation (such as the German Hazardous Materials Ordinance) and Miele\\u2019s internal regulations. To this end, Miele has its own company standard, which limits the use of certain substances in materials and compo- nents. Suppliers of manufacturing materials are only awarded contracts if they can con- firm compliance with this company standard. CORRUPTION PREVENTION AND COMPLIANCE Miele includes corruption prevention and com- pliance as part of its economic sustainability criteria. The criteria are based on the principles of the Global Compact of the United Nations (UN) and other > international guidelines. Staff in the Purchasing department must adhere to the > ethical guidelines for purchasing. Fair, transparent and partnership-based cooper- ation with suppliers is always paramount. The suppliers must state whether their com- pany participates in international or industry- related > compliance initiatives and whether they take measures to prevent corrup- tion \\u2013 for example, by providing an ombuds person for employees or considering the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) when selecting their upstream suppliers. Miele itself gives suppliers the opportunity to contact a specially appointed > ombudsperson. The ombudsperson acts as an independent contact person to employees, business partners and third parties should any suspicions of corruption or theft arise. Contact details for the ombudsperson are included in every Miele order. ESCALATION PROCESS IN THE CASE OF SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1] Suspicions or evi- dence that a supplier is violating SA8000 criteria or environmental standards trig- gers a multi-stage escalation process, which can culminate in the supplier being struck off the approved list and blocked for the future. Serious violations will generally lead to abso- lute and immediate termination of the contract. If investigations into a supplier reveal abnor- malities, the supplier may still be able to continue working with Miele depending on its subsequent development and improve- ment. However, the supplier in question must draw up an action plan in collaboration with Miele\\u2019s Purchasing and Quality Management departments and rectify the non-conform- ities in full within the specified period. Abnormalities were determined in relation to one supplier during the reporting period. The supplier in question was inspected according to the escalation plan and suc- cessfully implemented the measures agreed with Miele to rectify the issues. No sup- pliers were blocked in the reporting period.

The company is working to continuously reduce the envi- ronmental impact caused at its sites by waste water, waste and emissions, as well as energy-intensive processes and logis- tics. It manufactures all of its products in a resource-friendly manner, using as little energy as possible. Miele takes great pre- cautions here, ensuring that environmental protection is considered at an early stage when planning systems and processes. CERTIFIED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Miele uses an > integrated management system to manage operational environ- mental protection throughout the company. The environmental management system, which is certified according to ISO 14001 at all Miele production locations world- wide, is an important component of the integrated management system. It contains guidelines on how to deal with materials, water, waste and emissions. Miele also manages and monitors its environmental performance with the help of environmental performance indicators. The management system is reviewed at the beginning of each business year, with progress being meas- ured on the basis of the results of individual reviews conducted at the various Miele plants. These results are then used to set new objectives. The internal reviews are sup- plemented by external monitoring audits. Miele\\u2019s ISO 50001-certified > energy management system at all European pro- duction sites is another component of the integrated management system. This system helps the sites identify poten- tial for further energy savings and introduce corresponding measures. European sites are recertified in accor- dance with ISO 50001 every three years. The energy management system at Euro- pean sites was recertified at the end of 2020. The new washing machine plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, Poland, commenced operations in Sep- tember 2019 and achieved ISO 50001 certification in May 2021. The energy man- agement system at the Dongguan location in China is also based on ISO 50001. Management staff from different produc- tion sites regularly liaise on best practices. Miele reviews its energy management system annually by means of internal audits carried 918,000 \\u20ac was invested by Miele in environmental protection measures at its manufacturing sites in 2020. out by five specially trained employees. The audits performed in the business years 2019 and 2020 did not find any non-conformi- ties and only made recommendations for optimising individual process descriptions. Management has already begun imple- menting the improvements, which included coordinating the process of defining key performance indicators, as well as re - designing and simplifying energy reports. These audits ensure that Miele fulfils the national implementation of the 2015 Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), which requires companies to carry out an energy audit every four years. DIN EN 16247-1 energy audits are also performed at relevant sales subsidiaries. Energy management meetings took place online in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the number of meetings increased to four, with shorter intervals between meetings and more up-to-date discussions, which proved to be particularly advantageous with regard to the implementation of the ambitious new > sustainability strategy. In future, Miele plans to hold both online and in-person meetings depending on the subject matter. 56  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility plants and from Dongguan in China also reg- ularly attend the workshops in Germany.

Each area has its own responsible officers at the Miele head- quarters and at the individual plants. All of the plant officers report to the headquar- ters in G\\u00fctersloh. Information is shared between plants on a continuous basis, with operational environmental protection and energy management teams usually meeting twice a year at one of the German sites. These meetings are used to discuss individual efficiency projects, to provide information about changes in the legal framework and for further training. Representatives from other European [GRI 307-1] Miele operates a standardised legal management system for operational envi- ronmental protection, energy management and occupational health and safety at all of its German plants. This system monitors compli- ance with standards and legal requirements and continued to prove its worth during the reporting period. It guarantees consistent and simple compliance monitoring and makes it possible to additionally incorporate legal require- ments from official authorisations. Realising operational environmental protection remains the responsibility of each individual site. There were no recorded infringements of environ- mental regulations in the reporting period. PROFESSIONAL COMPLAINTS MANAGEMENT [GRI 413-1/-2] Employees, residents, busi- ness partners or other persons can report suspected violations of environmental pro- tection rules at any time and can get in touch with Miele by telephone, e-mail or letter. The headquarters or the plants are the main contacts for this purpose. The respon- sible department or the plant management will examine the situation and clarify or elim- inate the causes. In the event of a serious complaint, the company management will be involved at an early stage. No significant complaints concerning environmental emis- sions were received in the reporting period. MIELE SUPPORTS SUSTAINABLE LIVING IN THE CITY What will sustainable and energy-efficient living look like in the future? One possible answer is provided by a pilot > project in Melbourne: a self-sufficient house built by eco-innovator Joost Bakker in 2020 \\u2013 sponsored by the Australian sales company. The zero-waste house has closed cycles, supplies the res- idents with renewable energy and is geared towards urban fruit and vegetable cultivation. In addition to domestic appliances for the laundry room, Miele also provided a complete kitchen, including a wine con- ditioning unit. All appliances used in the house are solar powered. After delays due to the pandemic, the house was ready for moving in at the end of 2020.

However, its efforts also include avoiding waste and minimising water consumption, not only protecting the environment in the process, but also helping to ensure supply security and cut costs too. Miele continu- ously optimises its production processes for this purpose, reusing materials where pos- sible and recycling where not. Preferentially, materials are reused immediately or recycled. WASTE AVOIDANCE AND EXTENSIVE USE OF RECYCLING [GRI 306-1/-2] Waste can never be completely avoided in manufacturing. At Miele, waste is carefully separated into reusable containers on site as soon as it is produced. Miele uses specialist companies to dispose of waste. In the business year 2020, Miele plants pro- duced a total of 37,413 tonnes of waste, around 9.4 percent more than in 2019 (34,190 tonnes). This increase was due to a rise in production activity, as well as a greater volume of chrome steel waste from the commissioning of a new welding system in G\\u00fctersloh. The resulting scrap was recycled. However, the new system has also increased the level of vertical integra- tion at the G\\u00fctersloh site, as the parts (cast flanges) can now be produced in-house rather than being purchased. Another reason for the increase in waste was the soil extracted for a new supply duct at the Lehrte site. TOTAL WASTE PRODUCED in tonnes 2020 2019 37,413 34,190 DESTINATION OF TOTAL WASTE1) in tonnes 1,781 309 2,271 2020 Materials recycling, processing Energy recovery, incineration Physicochemical treatment Dumping 33,053 Miele reviews these companies in > waste disposal audits and works with other manufacturers within the scope of these audits. Besides the legal requirements defined in the German Waste Management Act (KrWG), the audits also look at additional aspects such as whether waste is checked, whether approvals have been provided for waste disposal facilities, what condition the laboratories are in and whether the scales have been calibrated properly. Waste disposal companies are responsible for recording waste output from Miele plants. When it comes to transporting hazardous waste, Miele only employs the services of specialist companies both in Ger- many and at its sites outside of Germany. Miele itself does not export any waste. A total of 95 percent of the waste produced at Miele\\u2019s plants worldwide was recycled in the business years 2019 and 2020. The volume of hazardous waste recycled and disposed of in the reporting period fell by a small margin of 4.2 percent from 2,687 tonnes to 2,574 tonnes in the reporting period. Numerous waste treatment facilities are cur- rently in the process of setting new acceptance criteria for recycling processes. In the past, sludge from Miele\\u2019s waste water processing facilities and foundry was recycled for use as a construction additive. This construction additive is used at landfill sites to secure waste and build access routes. With the number of landfill sites decreasing in Germany, this form of recycling will no longer be available in the future, which is why processing landfill waste will be classified as a waste disposal process rather than a recycling process moving forward. This would result in the share of Miele waste that is recycled falling markedly. RAISING AWARENESS AMONG EMPLOYEES [GRI 306-1/-2] All Miele employees need to pull their weight to ensure that waste is avoided as much as possible and disposed of prop- erly when it is produced. Miele has various measures to raise employee awareness of this topic, including noticeboards on how to properly separate waste at production sites. 1) See page 97 for further explanation. 58  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Miele\\u2019s sales subsidiary in Canada has introduced a system of waste separation and organised an employee competition to reduce waste. The Russian sales subsidiary has been working on measures to raise employee awareness of the environment in their day- to-day work since 2017 as part of the ECO Office project. In 2020, the office replaced single-use cutlery and plates, which were commonplace, with ceramic tableware and metal cutlery and installed a water dispenser. The same measures were intro- duced at the sales subsidiary in Italy. Both sales subsidiaries saw a marked decline in the use of plastic single-use bottles. The Australian sales subsidiary con- ducted an online survey on employees\\u2019 printing habits, which focused on ways of reducing the number of printed documents and general paper consumption. Around 250 employees took part in the survey in 2020, providing a great many ideas and sug- gestions. The company is currently working on a detailed proposal for implementation. SYSTEMATIC WATER MANAGEMENT [GRI 303-1] Miele is reliant on water throughout its value chain. Plants require cooling water to manufacture Miele appli- ances, and water is also needed to operate kitchens and bathroom facilities and for watering green spaces. The produc- tion plants in G\\u00fctersloh and Bra\\u0219ov cover most of their water requirements from their own well facilities, while other plants draw water from municipal systems. Miele strives to consistently reduce its water consumption through systematic water man- agement. All water-saving measures are, of course, implemented without affecting drinking water hygiene. As an example, Miele has spent the past few years sepa- rating its drinking water and firefighting water facilities at its G\\u00fctersloh site, which had pre- viously been operated as a single system. Miele installed smaller pipes for the drinking water system, allowing water consump- tion to be reduced. The old drinking water pipes were oversized for current drinking water requirements and had to be flushed out very often to prevent bacteria from building up. The large-diameter pipe network had been originally installed to provide effective and rapid access to large volumes of water to fight fires. However, a new 1,250 cubic metre water tank has since been installed to provide water for firefighting from 2021. Water abstraction per tonne of product climbed from 1.85 cubic metres in 2019 to 1.93 cubic metres in the business year 2020. In absolute terms, water abstraction increased from 358,789 cubic metres to 393,827 cubic metres year on year in the business year 2020 due to the repeated exchange of water in the cooling tower for hygiene reasons and the increased use of rinsing water during the commissioning of a cooling system in G\\u00fcter- sloh, among other factors. In addition, the new plant in Poland was included in the data for the first time in 2020. Another reason for the increased water consumption is the dry summer in 2020 and the need to water green spaces as a result. Drip irrigation sys- tems have been installed at some sites to reduce water consumption in the future. Plants outside of Germany have also imple- mented a water management system, including measures to reduce water con- sumption. In Dongguan, China, for instance, water meters have been installed to analyse water usage and set consumption targets. WASTE WATER: REGULAR MEASUREMENTS [GRI 303-1/-2, 306-3] The plants in G\\u00fcter- sloh, Oelde, Lehrte and B\\u00fcrmoos are able to discharge their waste water into the public sewer system due to its high quality. These indirect discharges are subject to the waste water regulations of the respective munic- ipalities. Waste water is treated before it is discharged, with heavy metals being pre- cipitated using lime milk in G\\u00fctersloh and Oelde to filter these substances out of the waste water. Precipitation is a chemical pro- cess for isolating a dissolved substance from a solution. The heavy metals are then deposited as particles and filtered out by the filters. In addition, the waste water is also neutralised. This all ensures that Miele complies with the limits stipulated by munic- ipal waste water regulations. Miele regularly conducts internal analysis and submits random samples to the authorities for anal- ysis to monitor the quality of this process. As at all other Miele plants, regular sam- ples are taken to ensure that the water WASTE WATER in cubic metres 2020 362,702 2019 313,264 quality is perfect. In the reporting period, there were no notable or significant cases of municipal limits being exceeded. At the Bra\\u015fov plant, domestic waste water is treated in the plant\\u2019s own biological treat- ment plant and before being discharged into the B\\u00e2rsa stream. But that is set to change from the end of 2021, when Miele waste water will be discharged through a new sewer system to a new public treatment plant, where it will be treated. So far, there are no manufacturing processes at the new Ksaw- er\\u00f3w plant that produce technical waste water. Other waste water produced by this plant is discharged into a municipal treat- ment plant through the public sewer system. On account of the increase in water con- sumption in the business year 2020, the waste water of all Miele plants climbed to 362,702 cubic metres in the business year 2020 (2019: 313,264 cubic metres). 59  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility Energy and emissions Focus on climate action Climate change is one of the greatest chal- lenges we face, and climate action is one of Miele\\u2019s key sustainability tasks. That is why Miele has refined its climate action strategy during the reporting period, defining ambi- tious new goals. The climate action strategy centres on avoiding and reducing CO2 emissions and compensating where such measures are not (yet) possible. The pri- mary instruments in Miele\\u2019s strategy are investment in efficiency measures, the expansion of in-house energy generation and the targeted reduction of emissions in the upstream and downstream value chain. CO2 NEUTRALITY FOR ALL SITES FROM 2021 As part of its climate strategy, Miele has decided to shift to carbon-neutral production from 2021, as relates to the company\\u2019s own emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions attrib- utable to energy suppliers (Scope 2). At the same time, the company aims to cut the CO2 emissions of its global production and sales sites, including the vehicle fleet, by 50 per- cent in absolute terms by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. To do so, Miele will be investing primarily in energy efficiency and gener- ating its own renewable energy at its sites. ELEMENTS OF THE MIELE CLIMATE STRATEGY Energy-efficient products Appropriate management mechanisms (internal CO2 price) Energy-efficient production The strategy was adopted by the Exec- utive Board in October 2020. A number of measures were then resolved and initial steps taken toward implemen- tation. The new climate strategy is an integral part of the enhanced > sustainability strategy, through which Miele notably refined its objectives in key focus areas in the reporting period. Compensation of unavoidable emissions ELEMENTS OF THE MIELE CLIMATE STRATEGY Sustainable materials By developing and adopting its new climate strategy, Miele meets the require- ments of the > Science Based Targets initiative, which aims to bring corporate climate targets in line with the latest climate findings.

But they can also improve the day-to-day lives of people, too. Since 2021, Miele has been involved in a project to equip rural households in Nepal with small biogas plants as part of the com- pany\\u2019s CO2 compensation project. Instead of using firewood to cook, and producing harmful smoke, fam- ilies use biogas. In addition, residual materials from the plants can be used as fertiliser, increasing agri- cultural yields. People are no longer reliant solely on wood, meaning that deforestation has also declined, helping to preserve species diversity and coun- teract soil erosion. A total of 350 biogas plants have been constructed with Miele\\u2019s assistance. PRODUCTS & SERVICES Supplier management SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility GENERATING OWN ENERGY AND PROCURING GREEN ELECTRICITY Miele commissioned a photovoltaic plant in Dongguan, China, in April 2021. Other projects are in the pipeline, both at Miele produc- tion sites and at sales companies. In addition, Miele is in the process of switching its energy supply to fully renewable sources, with all global sites set to procure green electricity by the end of 2021. The plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, which was opened at the start of 2019, has been using green electricity since produc- tion operations commenced. All production sites in Germany, as well as those in B\\u00fcrmoos, Bra\\u015fov and Uni\\u010dov, have been operating on renewable electricity since 2020. Many inter- national sales companies, such as those in the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as the Steelco Group, also operate on green electricity exclusively. projects in the United States to plant new hardwood forests in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which is one of North America\\u2019s most important deciduous forest ecosystems. PROMOTING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES Miele also supports innovative tech- nological approaches to reducing or sequestering carbon. One project in Austria and Germany supports the storage of carbon for agricultural use. In this project, vegetable carbon is being used for long-term carbon storage, and is applied to the soil, improving soil fer- tility and increasing humus levels in the process. Miele co-finances the project. REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF PRODUCTS COMPENSATION OF UNAVOIDABLE EMISSIONS Miele compensates for unavoidable emis- sions by purchasing high-quality CO2 certificates and investing in global climate action projects, including a solar-thermal project in India and a biogas project in Nepal. In Nicaragua, Miele supports an initiative for sustainable coffee growing. The tech- nical and financial support provided by Miele helps Nicaraguan farmers manage their plan- tations in a more environmentally friendly way. Other initiatives include reforesta- tion projects in Uganda, a country that has lost more than 40 percent of its forests in the past 20 years. Miele also supports The majority of the CO2 emissions that make up Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint are produced during the use of products (Scope 3.11) and during the purchasing of goods and services (Scope 3.1), both of which are areas where a further reduc- tion of CO2 emissions is necessary. Initial pilot projects are currently under way. THE JOURNEY TO THE CLIMATE STRATEGY Allocating emissions to certain activities is a key part of effective climate action. The annual > carbon footprint report acts as a basis for Miele\\u2019s current climate strategy process. 61  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Natural resources and materials Supplier management Environmental management Resource efficiency Energy and emissions Energy and emissions Logistics and mobility In 2020, at the beginning of the strategy process, Miele extended the coverage of its carbon footprint report to interna- tional sales subsidiaries, the Steelco Group and its shareholding in Korean robotics specialist Yujin. Miele also carried out poten- tial analysis, which was used to pinpoint energy- efficiency measures, evaluate the potential of own energy generation and green electricity procurement and quan- tify significant Scope 3 emissions. The next step was to simulate and model potential measures to cut Scope 1, 2 and 3 emis- sions and the resulting costs. At this stage, Miele also looked into potential strategies to achieve carbon neutrality through ener- gy-efficiency measures, ways to increase own energy generation, opportunities to increase the amount of green electricity and possibilities for carbon compensation. SYSTEMATIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT The energy industry in Germany and Europe is undergoing a structural shift towards solar and wind energy. However, both of these renewable sources are weather-de- pendent and therefore volatile. Energy bottlenecks must be avoided, and avail- ability and stable prices secured. Hence why it is important for Miele to adapt to the changes by implementing new energy storage concepts and efficient internal man- agement mechanisms. Miele firmly believes that the only way to absorb the differences between volatile supply and uniform demand is to store energy in the form of hydrogen, which is why the company is investing in the development of hydrogen-based energy storage solutions. Dr Reinhard Zinkann is a co-signatory to the white paper \\u201cAufbruch in die Zukunft: Transfor- mationspfade f\\u00fcr nachhaltige industrielle Projekte in Nordrhein-Westfalen\\u201d (Journey into the future: transformation path- ways for sustainable industrial projects in North Rhine-Westphalia), which con- tains 13 specific project proposals for the further development of hydrogen tech- nology. The paper is the result of top-level meetings initiated by the state gov- ernment of North Rhine-Westphalia. Energy storage is an important piece of the puzzle, but efficient energy flows are also crucial. Thanks to the ISO 50001 energy management standard, which has been applied since its introduction in 2011, Miele has been able to transparently doc- ument energy flows at its sites and, in doing so, uncover potential for improve- ments in efficiency. Within this framework, the company has also set up a number of > performance indicators to mon- itor achievement of efficiency targets and plan infrastructure measures. The foundry and enamelling processes are particu- larly energy-intensive parts of production. ESTABLISHING AN EFFICIENT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE Energy efficiency has always been a top priority at Miele, and not just with the company\\u2019s products. In the early 1980s, Miele began designing new build- ings with more efficient low-temperature systems and facilities. Nowadays, this tech- nology is being used on an increasing basis in modern heating networks. Miele has its own electricity grids at its plants and sites. Featuring 40 transformers, the grid at the G\\u00fctersloh site is comparable to that of a small town. Miele also feeds electricity into its internal grids with its cogeneration plants in B\\u00fcnde and Bielefeld, and the pho- tovoltaic system in G\\u00fctersloh. This kind of infrastructure has been a resounding suc- cess so far, which is why Miele believes that small electricity grids with decentral- ised energy generation and storage can play a major role in the energy transition. In G\\u00fctersloh, Miele is also a partner in the city\\u2019s heat distribution network, with waste heat from a high-efficiency gas-fired power station used to heat the entire G\\u00fctersloh site since 2008 \\u2013 and improving the energy yield of the power station turbines in the pro- cess. Miele continues to hold small boiler systems on standby as a contingency for its production activities. The family-owned company is in constant dialogue with dis- trict heating provider Fernw\\u00e4rmegesellschaft G\\u00fctersloh to increase the efficiency of the network and reveal untapped potential. ENERGY EFFICIENCY COMPETENCY NETWORK Maintaining and facilitating dialogue is an area of extreme importance to Miele, which is why the company has its own com- petency network on the issue of energy efficiency.

The network\\u2019s experts form various working groups to look into issues or technologies such as com- pressed air or refrigeration systems. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the network met up as often as three times a year. In 2020, the meetings were organised online, and members of the network quickly realised that online meetings can also have added bene- fits: Teams met more frequently, the issues they discussed were more relevant and out- comes were more effective. Competency network meetings in the reporting period focused on improving and enhancing the sys- tems used to measure energy consumption.

Total energy consumption is made up of direct energy consumption (heating oil, natural gas) and indirect consumption (district heating and electrical energy); see diagram below. The > Key figures section includes a detailed breakdown and explanations. Specific energy consumption per produced appli- ance was reduced further in the reporting period. In the business year 2020, the lion\\u2019s share of energy requirements (86 per- cent) were covered by green electricity. In 2021, all sites use green electricity.

Employees can also com- plete an e-learning module on the subject, or find a broad range of information on how to save energy in their day-to-day work on the company intranet. The information is pre- pared for different target groups, such as office personnel and employees working in plant engineering, and is continuously updated. Tips include how to save energy through correct ventilation and heating. CURRENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION [GRI 305-1/-2/-3/-5] Miele\\u2019s carbon footprint is calculated on the basis of the international Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. It is prepared using a market-based approach, which applies the specific emission factors of energy suppliers. Emissions consist of direct emissions from oil and gas consumption as well as Miele\\u2019s fleet of vehicles (Scope 1), indirect emissions from electricity and dis- trict heating (Scope 2) and indirect Scope 3 emissions. Besides purchased goods and services and the use of sold products, Scope 3 emissions now also include capital goods, fuel- and energy-related emis- sions, transportation and distribution, waste, business travel, commuting, rented facil- ities and how sold products are handled at the end of their lifecycle.

Direct emissions (Scope 1) were cut by 8 percent in the same period. This is due to the reduced consumption of natural gas and heating oil and the pandemic-based decline in fleet mileage. Miele reduced indirect emissions (Scope 2) by a much larger margin of 65 percent on account of most of Miele\\u2019s sites covering their energy requirements with green electricity (86 percent). Moreover, electricity and district heat consumption fell further year on year. remaining 30 percent are currently in the process of being converted to use R290-grade fluid. Appliances produced for commercial applications. will only be filled with R600a refrigerant from 2021. Motor production at the Euskirchen site produces volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs), but these pollutants are eliminated by a post-combustion process, bringing the total amount in exhaust air below legal limits. HOW TO DEAL WITH ADDITIONAL GREENHOUSE GASES AND OTHER EMISSIONS [GRI 305-7] In addition to CO 2 emis- sions, Miele also strives to reduce other greenhouse gases and harmful emissions. Refrigerants containing chlorofluorocar- bons (CFCs) are still occasionally used at Miele plants: for example for air-con- ditioning technology, compressed air dryers and small-scale systems such as climate-controlled chests. These refrig- erants are gradually being replaced by more climate-friendly alternatives. Miele products also contain refrigerants, but since 2020 only R600a-grade fluid has been used worldwide. In 2020, 70 per- cent of heat pump tumble dryers were also produced using the environmentally friendly refrigerant R290 (propane).

The task of the logistics depart- ment is to make sure that Miele is able to supply its products on time to sales sub- sidiaries and customers all over the world. Miele has set itself the objective of mini- mising the impact of this level of traffic on the environment and the climate as much as possible, as well as optimising the nec- essary shipments. This is achieved using state-of-the-art logistics processes from the central Miele logistics centre in G\\u00fctersloh. Most delivery routes are relatively short: eight out of twelve of the Miele production sites are located in Germany, with the fur- thest situated 215 kilometres away from G\\u00fctersloh. Europe continues to be the key market for Miele products, as over 80 per- cent of sales are generated there \\u2013 and one third in Germany alone. The neces- sary shipments and deliveries are managed efficiently. In addition, Miele aims to uti- lise modes of transport that generate the lowest possible level of emissions. Carbon emissions are a significant selection crite- rion for Miele when it comes to awarding contracts to transport service providers. The company avoids the use of air freight as far as possible and carefully reviews any instances of transportation by air. SHIPPING THE MOST IMPORTANT MODE OF TRANSPORT Transport volumes rose by 12 percent in the business year 2020 to 1,008 million tonne-kilometres (compared to the busi- ness year 2019). This includes transport on own account and deliveries to Miele sales subsidiaries (outbound). The increase is mainly due to the positive sales develop- ment at sales subsidiaries overseas, as well as in Southern and Eastern Europe. Miele successfully maintained the propor- tion of its outbound shipments transported by ship and rail at an extremely high level of over 85 percent. Once again, an extremely low percentage of shipments were made by air (0.8 percent). Of Miele\\u2019s transport on own account, 43 percent was com- pleted by ship and 57 percent by lorry. CALCULATING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND OTHER EMISSIONS [GRI 305-3] Miele uses software to determine the environmental impact of its transport logistics that calculates the transport volume and greenhouse gas emissions based on the OUTBOUND TRANSPORT VOLUME in shares (related to tonne-kilometres) 2 1 14 2020 83 by ship by rail by lorry by air EN 16258 CEN standard. In the business year 2020, transport-related emissions increased by 3 percent, from 60,235 tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2019 to 62,212 tonnes CO2-equivalent. These emissions include outbound logistics, global distribution and transport on own account. The rise in CO2 emissions was much less significant than the increase in transport volume. Noise also forms part of transport-related emissions. Noise emissions are legally regulated in Germany and in many other countries. Certain noise thresholds must not be exceeded, especially at night, to protect the public and the areas around the plants from harmful noise-related environmental effects. This is monitored on the basis of a noise register containing all noise sources. Miele adhered to all requirements during the reporting period. OPTIMAL USE OF TRANSPORT VEHICLE CAPACITIES A key way of reducing the environmental impact of transport is the optimal utilisa- tion of the means of transport in procurement and distribution logistics.

In Germany, it is responsible for identifying and hiring suitable applicants. The sales subsidiaries have their own HR managers and/or departments. The central HR department coordinates its activi- ties regularly with the individual departments, local HR departments, the management of the sales subsidiaries and the works council. In industrialised countries, demographic change is intensifying the competition for well-trained specialists. Global markets and increasing digital connectivity are also changing the demands employees face. Strategic human resources management constantly aims to attract a sufficient number of qualified, creative and enthusiastic minds to the company and to ensure their long-term loyalty, even under the present conditions. This is crucial in supporting Miele\\u2019s efforts to be an innovation leader in the industry on a lasting basis. The focus is on the short-, medium- and long-term need for employees in all areas of the company.

The Miele employer brand is a central element of the Human Resources strategy and helps make Miele even more appealing to highly qualified young pro- fessionals. The company is increasingly looking not only for candidates with tech- nical profiles, but IT and digitalisation professionals as well. Miele posts ads for these prospective employees, particu- larly on the internet and on social media. STRONG IDENTIFICATION WITH MIELE Since 2012, Miele has carried out employee surveys to measure how satis- fied employees are in their workplace and how strongly they identify with the com- pany. Miele focuses on different issues and metrics depending on the location. 240 anniversaries were celebrated in 2020. the company placed 41st. Some 143,000 company evaluations were considered for the study. Another magazine, stern, ranked Miele the 25th most popular employer and first in the \\u201cDurable Con- sumer Goods\\u201d category in 2019. This survey involved 45,000 employees in Germany. STAFF RETENTION: LOW TURNOVER RATES, LOTS OF ANNIVERSARIES [GRI 401-1] Miele is traditionally characterised by a high rate of staff retention. Most employees stay with Miele for many years. The staff turnover rate at the German locations stood at 1.33 percent in the business year 2020 (2019: 1.76 percent). Numerous anniversaries were celebrated in the reporting period. In the business year 2020, 240 employees worldwide celebrated 25, 40 and even 50 years with the company (2019: 319 employees with anniversaries). Local celebrations were postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. mented, helping save over 1.9 million euros. A total of 371,000 euros were paid out as bonuses in the business year 2020. The Miele idea management programme is being fully digitalised by stages. This will enable greater transparency and process speed and may make it easier to share knowledge. In 2018, Miele renamed its corporate sugges- tion scheme, dubbing it \\u201cIdee M\\u201d (\\u201cIdea M\\u201d), while also modernising various processes in an effort to respond even more flexibly to ideas when they are received. Idee M launched a campaign called \\u201c120 Jahre Immer Besser\\u201d (\\u201c120 Years, Ever Better\\u201d), inviting employees to win special prizes if their suggestions were accepted by the idea management pro- gramme. All entrants also received physical prizes and a 20 percent addition to the usual idea bonus. During the campaign, 1,521 ideas were submitted and then reviewed and evaluated by experts with an eye to implemen- tation. In 2019, 2,983 ideas were submitted, and the number for 2020 was 1,659. The sharp change was due to the reduction in on-site work brought on by the pandemic. The last surveys were conducted in 2018, eliciting feedback from employees of sales subsidiaries and the Bra\\u015fov, Dongguan and Uni\\u010dov plants. These surveys showed high levels of identification and engagement among the international workforce, well above the average of the manufacturing industry. The next worldwide survey is scheduled for 2021.

PRO-GE is the responsible trade union in Austria, with KOVO acting as our labour partner in the Czech Republic. The plant in Bra\\u015fov, Romania, is subject to a collective labour agreement that governs the funda- mental demands, as well as the organisation and structure of employment relationships. Working conditions for employees in Ger- many, Austria, the Czech Republic and Romania are therefore all regulated in collec- tive bargaining agreements, equating to a 66.8 percent share of all Miele employees (as at 31 December 2020). The employment relationship between Miele and the tempo- rary agency workers employed at Miele\\u2019s German locations is governed by the collec- tive wage agreements concluded by the agencies themselves. Works councils look after the interests of employees in Germany and at our Czech plant, as well as at some of our sales subsid- iaries, such as in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Employees at our plant in Dongguan, China, for example, have enjoyed representation since 2009. Such representation is not mandatory under local law. The employee representatives there meet with the HR department on a monthly basis to discuss suggestions and deal with potential areas of conflict. The interests of the employees at the plant in Uni\\u010dov, Czech Republic, are represented through the KOVO union and in regular meetings between internal employee representatives and plant management. At smaller sales subsidiaries, such as those in Poland or Ireland, the dialogue between employees and manage- ment is a direct and ongoing process, but has not been formally defined. SOCIAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS [GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-1/-2] Miele is respectful and responsible in its dealings with employees. This is a key feature of the Miele corporate culture, and one that has been under- scored since back in 2004 by the company\\u2019s voluntary pledge to fulfil the internationally rec- ognised SA8000 social standard. This has been officially certified since 2008. The standard includes the requirement to observe decent working conditions, to guarantee freedom of association and the prohibition of child labour and discrimination. An external service pro- vider performs a monitoring audit every six months to determine whether this standard is met. All plant locations are > SA8000 certified and undergo recertification every three years. The most recent scheduled recertification took place in 2019; the plant in Ksawer\\u00f3w, Poland, is slated for recertification in 2022. It goes without saying that Miele respects human rights in all its business activities. Miele conveys this pledge to employees as part of the company philosophy right from the beginning of their employment. In the reporting period, 115 managers and employees from HR were trained with an online learning programme on the German General Act on Equal Treatment (Allge- meines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz, or AGG). Since the programme was introduced, a total of 1,649 employees have completed the training. Software-based training is also held 4,126 employees have been digitally trained on the Code of Conduct. on the company\\u2019s code of conduct. So far, 4,126 have received training worldwide, 699 of them during the reporting period. Miele also requires its suppliers to comply with > social criteria. Miele purchasing employees receive regular information to raise aware- ness of this topic. Venues for providing information include the semiannual meetings of SA8000 management representatives, the quarterly meetings of the social performance teams and the company-wide SA8000 infor- mation portals. In 2019, the company began holding meetings with the central purchasing team every six weeks to optimise procure- ment processes in keeping with ethics standards. The focus here is on cross- plant coordination and on implementation of SA8000 requirements by suppliers, taking country-specific circumstances into account. Miele also provides new hires with infor- mation about complying with social and ethical standards during the two-day \\u201cWelcome@Miele\\u201d event. New Miele employees get to know the company and its culture in depth during this onboarding event. TRANSPARENT COMPLAINTS PROCESS [GRI 406-1] Every employee in Germany has the right to turn to a complaints office, which offers help as the first point of contact in the case of suspected discrim- ination. In accordance with the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), the works council is involved in handling and evalu- ating incoming complaints. Miele has set up dedicated complaints offices, each of which is staffed by one man and one 70  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement woman, at every company location in Germany. All complaints are naturally con- fidential. Similar systems are in place at the international sites. The complaints office works closely with the aggrieved person to review the circumstances surrounding the complaint. Wherever possible, the results of the review are communicated within one month. Information on how to contact the individual complaints offices is accessible to all employees on the intranet. In addi- tion, employees or business partners of Miele or other third parties can contact an ombudsperson if they believe there are indi- cations that criminal laws have been violated within the company\\u2019s sphere of influence. In the reporting period, the com- plaints offices in Germany received a total of one AGG complaint related to gender and ethnic background. In this case, remedial measures were taken and further support was offered. FAIR PAY \\u2013 NATURALLY [GRI 202-1] Miele believes in paying all employees an appropriate wage or salary based on collective and corporate agree- ments. Such pay meets or exceeds > the real-world living wage at the loca- tion in question and comes with a variety of voluntary benefits. In keeping with the founders\\u2019 philosophy, such benefits are paid regardless of the current eco- nomic climate or business performance. The company stands by its pledge to be an attractive employer, even \\u2013 and espe- cially \\u2013 in tough economic times. A LONG TRADITION OF COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS [GRI 201-3, 401-2, 404-2] Miele has offered its employees a company pension scheme since 1929. Today, Miele supports its employees in Germany in saving for retire- ment through a variety of models, such as private pension schemes or deferred com- pensation. Depending on the company agreement and collective wage agreement, employees in Germany can pay up to 4 per- cent of the contribution assessment ceiling for pension insurance (Western states) into a tax-privileged pension insurance fund. Miele grants special one-off payments and allowances for health treatments and dental prostheses that go beyond the stat- utory requirements and the provisions of the collective wage agreements, as well as payments in the event of births, marriages, deaths, milestone birthdays and work anni- versaries. In addition, employees receive benefits and individually negotiated perks such as meal subsidies and coverage of travel expenses. The company provides its former and active employees with modern health insurance coverage through its com- pany insurance provider. Some sales subsidiaries also have separate health insurance programmes for their employees. They also provide their employees with the option of discounted supplemental insurance policies, such as denture insur- ance. In some cases, employees can also take advantage of pension, health, invalidity and survivors insurance. 1929 was the year Miele introduced company retirement benefits. Both in Germany and internationally, benefits are granted regardless of whether employees have full-time, part-time, tem- porary or permanent contracts. Rules on company pensions vary internationally due to local differences and legal requirements. GOOD INTEGRATION OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES [GRI 102-8] In the business year 2020, the share of the workforce in Germany con- sisting of temporary employees stood at 5 percent, up from 3.4 percent in 2019. In a company-wide agreement signed in 2007, Miele committed to only work with recruit- ment agencies that have concluded a collective wage agreement. This regulates pay and the industry supplement, which is between 15 and 30 percent of the base pay under the collective agreement for the metal industry. In the company-wide agree- ment, Miele also agreed to increase the pay of temporary agency employees by an addi- tional 6 to 8 percent (scaled according to duration of the employment period). 71  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement AWARDS: RECOGNITION FOR HR POLICIES Miele has received several awards for its exemplary HR work.

Employees in Germany may take advan- tage of flexitime, provided there are no production-related reasons or other urgent considerations to the contrary. In the business year 2020, the percentage of employees with flexitime stood at 59 percent.

The models provide various part-time or full-time employ- ment arrangements. In the business year 2019, the proportion of employees working part-time in Germany was 8.0 percent, while in the business year 2020, this figure stood at 8.2 percent.

A healthy workforce is the foundation of long-term success for any company. Supporting and maintaining employees\\u2019 physical and mental abilities to perform is therefore the very highest priority. The basis for these efforts is a thoughtfully conceived, prevention-driven health man- agement programme, combined with safe and ergonomically designed workplaces. A CLEAR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY ORGANISATION [GRI 403-1/-4/-5/-7/-8] As an employer, Miele is responsible for its employees\\u2019 safety. To keep everyone safe, all Miele plants worldwide have obtained certification under the internationally recognised DIN EN ISO 45001 > occupational safety management system. This type of certifi- cation fully replaces the previous OHSAS 18001 framework. The company was recertified in 2020. 4% of the entire workforce is involved in Work Safety Committees. at Miele is directly involved with these commit- tees. These meetings shifted to digital in 2020. In Germany, the Works Constitution Act gov- erns how the works councils of the plants should be involved in matters of workplace health and safety. On the international front, there are corresponding regulations that govern the involvement of employees and their representa- tives. All rules on occupational safety and health also apply to non-Miele employees whose work and/or workplaces are controlled by Miele. The age structure remains a challenge for Miele. At the end of the business years 2019 and 2020, about 46 percent of employees in Germany were 50 years old or above, with the average age as at 31 December 2020 standing at 46.76 years. This means that workstations must be designed to be both age-appropriate and appropriate for ageing workers. To Miele, this means creating suitable pathways for dif- ferent age groups. During this reporting period, the company analysed whether workstations and workflows in production, particularly series production, were ergonomically designed. The results of this analysis were used to revise a number of processes. In assembly, the com- pany worked with employees to develop ideas for an overhaul. In addition, jobs that are espe- cially physically demanding received relief from driverless transport systems and automation. Miele has 24 dedicated specialists employed solely for the purpose of ensuring occupational safety at its plants (in the business year 2020). In addition, the company also has 235 safety officers who perform these tasks alongside their regular company duties. These include pro- viding advice during the planning and realisation of plant systems or when workstations are being designed. The safety officers receive regular con- tinuing education, including quarterly training on various safety topics ranging from haz- ardous substances to noise. Furthermore, regular instruction takes place at all locations. Extensive checklists are available for daily work activities. Regular safety meetings are held at all plants and all departments are frequently inspected. The inspections ensure that the necessary actions are taken conscientiously. Approximately 20 to 25 inspections per year are conducted in G\\u00fctersloh alone. There are also regular continuing educa- tion and training activities to raise all employees\\u2019 awareness of safety in the workplace. Owing to the pandemic, all meetings were held digi- tally in 2020 and inspections were conducted with appropriate safeguards in place. The con- tinuing education and training measures were limited to systematic activities, and specifically those relating to occupational safety and health, which totalled 1,112 in the business year 2020. In addition, the Work Safety Committee at each plant meets four times a year. Approximately four percent of the entire company workforce FOCUS ON COVID-19 PREVENTION [GRI 403-8] The > pandemic made 2020 an exceptionally challenging year in terms of occupational safety and health at Miele. The company needed to maintain business oper- ations while at the same time protecting employees. The measures taken were guided by the SARS-CoV-2 occupational safety stand- ards published by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and further official rules (including the ordinances enacted by the German states to curb the pandemic) and went beyond the legal requirements in some cases. Various interdepartmental and local teams were formed to help fight the virus, map- ping out actions and solutions and taking over responsibility for communication within 73  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES HR management Occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety the company. A dedicated section of the intranet was set up to provide additional information on current developments, help with people\\u2019s day-to-day work and answer many questions from employees.

WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS Reportable workplace accidents 187 200 2019 2020 Employees with office workstations were asked to work from home for a short time. Those who had to continue working on-site were required to wear face masks as soon as they left their workstations. Beyond that, masks were required for all workstations where social distance of 1.5 meters could not be maintained. In production, employees were divided into shift groups, and break times were staggered to minimise contact. Workplace accidents per one million working hours 2019 2020 9.9 10.5 Hand sanitiser and disinfectant dispensers were installed across the board, and social distancing markings were placed on the floor at all building entrances and exits. The cafe terias were temporarily closed and then reopened with special hygiene and col- lection concepts. Occupancy limits were put in place for offices and meeting rooms to ensure sufficient distance. Wherever minimum distances could not be main- tained, such as in production, partitions were installed. Most meetings were held online rather than in person. Beyond that, the occupational health and safety officers worked with the plant medical service to offer advice on events. Multiple testing sta- tions were set up at the plants, offering Miele employees the chance to be tested for the virus several times a week.

In the course of these activities, supervisors, occupational safety special- ists, safety officers, company medical officers, and works council members were all asked to update risk assessments and define imme- diate actions to take in case of emergency. Since Miele is a production company with a high level of vertical integration, some of the jobs carry health risks or are particu- larly hazardous, such as those involved in the surface treatment of materials and in metal- working. Numerous measures are taken to eliminate or mitigate risks, from risk assess- ments of workstations and psychological strain, some of which are required by law, to protective clothing and training activ- ities aimed at preventing accidents. Training, posted notices and app notifica- tions advise employees when there is any change in the required protective measures. In addition, employees can report any dan- gers directly to their supervisor during daily team meetings. External companies and their employees who enter Miele grounds receive timely information from Miele about the occu- pational safety requirements that apply there. FIRST AID IN EMERGENCIES AND ACUTE CASES [GRI 403-3] A plant medical service has been in place since 1973 in G\\u00fctersloh. Along with the legal duties which result from the Occupational Safety Act, the plant med- ical service also takes care of first aid in the event of emergencies and acute illnesses. They work together with the Miele com- pany insurance provider BKK to provide and actively promote the annual influenza vaccination. At all other sites, insurance-ac- credited physicians and medical personnel ensure that employees receive proper care.

The other sites also held Health Day events focusing on topics such as healthy eating, coping with stress, protecting one\\u2019s skin, restful sleep and cardiovascular disease. Over 6,400 people participated in these occupa- tional health management activities across all German sites in 2019. All events and courses were initially cancelled at the start of the pandemic, in 2020, but they were then gradually brought back in online for- mats. This was the reason for the significant decrease in the total number of participants. Closely linked with Miele\\u2019s occupational health management activities, the company also engages in occupational integration management at all German sites (plants and sales and service centres). It is intended to make it easier for employees who have suffered from lengthy periods of illness to return to their jobs. 900 managers have participated in qualification seminars on the topic of \\u201cHealthy Management\\u201d. of them support employees in relation to var- ious health-related topics, like healthy eating and coping with depression and addiction. In Switzerland, Miele offers its workforce at the showroom in Crissier a gym membership. In China, the Baltic States, the Netherlands and Sweden as well, the Miele sites sup- port sports activities and the health of their employees. In Russia, monthly seminars are offered on maintaining a healthy work- life balance, with topics including things like coping with stress and healthy eating. and health. Over 900 managers \\u2013 the vast majority \\u2013 have participated since the seminars were first offered, in 2015. At the Bielefeld, G\\u00fctersloh and Oelde sites, managers who work in production receive additional training on how to wel- come new employees in a spirit of respect and appreciation. Miele also ensures that managers develop an eye for proper ergo- nomic working. In this way, they can help employees work more ergonomi- cally, including with help from the health management team where needed. LIFE COACHING AND ADDICTION COUNSELLING [GRI 404-2] Miele began offering employees at the German plants the option to seek life coaching and addiction counselling in early 2014. Trained contact persons are available to provide assistance. In addition, a 24-hour counselling hotline is also available through a service provider to handle crisis situa- tions. The two counsellors in G\\u00fctersloh alone logged some 400 consultations from mid-2019 to mid-2020. Frequent topics include work- place incidents, psychological strain and family issues. Beyond the counselling itself, smoking cessation programmes have also been offered. SPECIAL PROGRAMMES FOR APPRENTICES AND TRAINEES Promoting health is also an integral fea- ture of vocational training activities at Miele. All apprentices and trainees participate in five required events as part of the health insur- ance programme \\u201cAzubi fit\\u201d. These include an introduction to occupational health and a seminar on maintaining a healthy back. During this reporting period, the programme was also expanded to include identifying and coping with stress or addiction. All pro- gramme activities moved online in 2020. Technical apprentices also attend training ses- sions offered by professional associations. WIDE RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS Miele offers extensive occupational health management measures for employees at international locations as well.

For this reason, Miele continues to collaborate with schools and universities in the vicinity of the locations. ENTRY OPPORTUNITIES AT MIELE School pupils and leavers All employees benefit from a wide range of training and qualification options. In Germany, the company invested 17 million euros in vocational training and further development in the calendar year 2020 (calendar year 2019: 18.1 million). Against the backdrop of an > ageing population, the company\\u2019s focus lies increasingly on measures aimed at ensuring performance and employability in the long term. Students DIVERSE ENTRY-LEVEL POSITIONS FOR YOUNG PROFESSIONALS Graduates with Bachelor\\u2019s and Master\\u2019s degree Miele offers talented young professionals numerous opportunities for joining the com- pany.

The number of apprenticeships and positions for stu- dents in dual study programmes at Miele is determined by the company\\u2019s requirements in consultation with the departments as part of the strategic human resources plan- ning process. Once they have completed their training, Miele offers all apprentices an employment contract for a minimum of one year or even a permanent contract. continue to be made available to appren- tices in the future. A wide range of hands-on opportunities for technical apprentices have been created at the sales subsidi- aries in Ireland and Italy and at the plant in B\\u00fcrmoos, Austria. In all, eleven appren- tices and trainees, eleven students enrolled in dual programmes, and two interns spent time abroad during the reporting period. AWARDS FOR GRADUATES AND NEW PATHS TO VOCATIONAL TRAINING not only an electrical systems installer voca- tional training track, but also a business traineeship toward certification as a manage- ment assistant in industry. The quality of Miele\\u2019s programmes for young professionals was confirmed in 2020 by the Clevis corporate consultancy. Miele was ranked second in a study of the best German employers for young professionals and named \\u201cRising Star of the Year\\u201d (Aufsteiger des Jahres) for its dramatically improved ranking. When training its young professionals, Miele is careful to ensure that they develop digital skills and then apply them at the company. During this reporting period, for example, two new dual programmes with a focus on digital aspects were introduced. The \\u201cDigital Technologies\\u201d programme gives partici- pants extensive professional knowledge and skills relating to advanced informa- tion and communication technologies and fundamental knowledge of engineering. The \\u201cDigital Business Management\\u201d pro- gramme offers a broad-based education in business administration, expanding on the fundamentals of traditional business administration and adding solid IT-related basics. Three students started in these dual programmes in September 2020. INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR APPRENTICES AND STUDENTS Gathering international experience is playing an ever greater role in training at Miele, which is why more assignments abroad will 459 apprentices and trainees in Germany at the start of vocational training in September 2020 The high quality of training at Miele is regularly confirmed externally. In the business years 2019 and 2020, a total of 33 apprentices in Germany passed their final exams with flying colours, earning the best possible marks. Nine of them were also named \\u201cbest in chamber\\u201d (Kammerbeste) by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry. As part of the \\u201cCollective Labour Agreement for the Promotion of Apprenticeship Profi- ciency\\u201d (Tarifvertrag zur F\\u00f6rderung der Ausbildungsf\\u00e4higkeit), Miele offers internships to disadvantaged young people and those with lower academic performance. The objective is to open up a path for them into vocational training. Since 2009, this pro- gramme has successfully helped prepare 22 young people for an apprenticeship at Miele. In the business year 2019, two young men successfully completed the programme. Both began training to become industrial mechanics in September 2019. In 2020, two young men also started their training after successfully completing their internships. This was the first year that candidates were offered DUAL STUDY PROGRAMMES AT MIELE Since 1995, Miele has been offering school graduates the opportunity to complete var- ious commercial and technical dual study programmes in fields such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or busi- ness informatics. During the reporting period, 54 graduates successfully completed their dual study programmes, with over 80 per- cent of them going on to be hired by Miele. PROGRAMMES FOR UNIVERSITY GRADUATES Miele offers attractive entry-level opportunities for specialists and managers with an aca- demic background. Along with direct entry, there are two further entry-level programmes for graduates with bachelor\\u2019s degrees: The Master@Miele programme is a part-time master\\u2019s degree programme, usually with a technical focus. The Junior Sales Represent- ative Programme for entry into sales is also open to recruits who have not followed a tra- ditional career path. The programme gives talented candidates from other industries or 77  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement disciplines the opportunity to become junior sales representatives within just one year. INTERNSHIPS, SCHOLARSHIPS AND UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS During the reporting period, Miele offered more than 250 internships and thesis super- vision positions each year. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company was able to continue to offer internships and coop- erative relationships focusing on thesis projects. Most internships were con- ducted both on-site and through remote work on an alternating basis, with pro- fessional supervision at all times. Miele stays in close contact with selected technical and business-oriented universities around the world with the aim of contacting future applicants at an early stage and in a targeted manner. For example, the com- pany assigns practical projects to students, organises application and assessment centre training and offers excursions. In the reporting period, Miele was represented once more at numerous trade fairs for stu- dents, graduates and young professionals. In 2020, Miele shifted its participation in recruiting fairs to a different model. After a several-month phase when all fairs were cancelled by organisers and participating companies due to the pandemic, a shift toward digital formats began to take shape around the middle of the year. Miele partic- ipated in smaller events in this space, with up to 50 attendees. These new dialogue for- mats proved to be a good way to open up direct lines of communication with low bar- riers to entry, and Miele was able to recruit young professionals through these avenues. In its home region of eastern Westphalia, Miele offers ten scholarships a year to espe- cially talented candidates as part of the Deutschlandstipendium programme, com- bining them with social engagement and measures to support talented candidates. The Chinese plant in Dongguan awards four scholarships every year to students from the Dongguan Technology College who stand out as a result of their out- standing performance. Priority is given to students from less privileged back- grounds who perform at the same level. WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FOR TRAINING AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT [GRI 404-1/-2] A variety of training pro- grammes make a pivotal contribution to continuing to ensure the company\\u2019s suc- cess in the future. The responsibility for these programmes lies with the training divi- sion. Miele is involved in various different initiatives to get prospective young pro- fessionals interested in the company at an early stage. For example, the company participates in Girls\\u2019 Day. Its interna- tional trainee programme is one way Miele is putting its global focus into practice. HR development at Miele has an interna- tional focus. Succession management, for example, follows a uniform, IT-supported pro- cess throughout the company, which allows an overall view of all management posi- tions and makes it possible to come up with the best succession solutions for cer- tain people or positions early on. Part-time further training is of particular strategic sig- nificance to the company. To hold our own and continue to innovate, we need to pro- vide targeted support for employees to reach their full potential. Key development pro- grammes for talented professionals and to provide training for managers are increas- ingly being expanded internationally. In the process, Miele does not focus solely on specific on-the-job requirements, but also takes employees\\u2019 individual skills and aptitudes into account. Measures to sup- port employees\\u2019 growth and development at Miele include the following in particular: Systematic further training and advancement of skilled personnel and managers from within the company Continuous development and expansion of an international talent management process Goal-oriented HR development measures for specific target groups Ensuring internal knowledge management and employee networking Standardisation of learning processes across all locations Further development at Miele is a standardised process and is supported by a learning man- agement system (LMS) software solution that is 8.9 hours were spent by Miele employees on development on average in 2020. increasingly being used internationally as well. Opportunities for further training are planned and documented via the LMS, giving managers an overview of the progress that employees are making with their further development. Learning plans document the qualification measures planned for employees as well as the ones they have already completed. In addition, Miele intro- duced an online evaluation of further training measures in the 2019\\u20132020 period. Participants reported average satisfaction levels with their training measures of more than 5.2 on a scale from 1 to 6, with 6 being the highest possible rating. Ninety-five percent of respondents would recommend Miele\\u2019s training measures to others. The \\u201cMiele Change Agent\\u201d is one element of the LMS. This digital training format is part of the extensive worldwide learning and sup- port options offered in the Design2Excellence programme, preparing employees for the > transformation of Miele that is associated with the programme. About 30 people com- pleted the course during this reporting period. 78  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT CYCLE l t i f t On-the-job implementation, consolidation Q u alifi catio n m easures Planning and budgetary approval of needs-based qualification ployee review m E D e t e r m i n i n g i o n a l e d u c a t n e e d s R e c ordin alifi q u g n e atio c e d s-b n in L a s e d M S The annual employee review, which brings together managers and employees to dis- cuss performance, is another tool for managing the need for professional development based on specific job and skill requirements. DIGITAL LEARNING Miele made further strides in adopting dig- ital learning technologies in 2020. Working in tandem with external training institutions, the company shifted almost all areas of its training activities to digital learning formats. This allowed Miele to meet employees\\u2019 edu- cation needs even without holding in-person events. Things like LinkedIn Learning were helpful here. This extensive digital learning platform offered by professional social network LinkedIn has been available to Miele employees since January 2020. The \\u201cDigital Fitness\\u201d training initiative was also launched in 2020. Its goal is to raise awareness of the digital transformation among all employees and boost digital skills at the company. Plans call for the programme to be expanded further in the years to come. TEACHING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS \\u2013 AND ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEES TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE [GRI 404-2] Within the scope of its internal further training programmes, Miele pro- vides qualification opportunities for various fields such as management, project and change management, or IT applications. Miele bases various overarching, central qualification topics and specific qualification measures on its Miele competency model, which describes the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to be successful at the company. Through job descrip- tions, the model provides career planning assistance, for example. Miele also offers employees the opportunity to advance their management skills internationally. A very broad range of options are offered for advancing technical and professional skills. Miele uses a certified project man- agement training programme from the International Project Management Associ- ation (IPMA). The company introduced the programme in product development back in 2010, to great success, and has now been expanding it to other areas of the company. Certified project managers can manage complex projects with excellent structure and organisation and have a shared under- standing of how projects are executed at the Group level. The crucial factor is that many projects are growing increasingly com- plex, even those outside traditional product development. Miele now has more than 200 employees trained as project managers. In addition, employees in Germany have the opportunity to further their education by attending external training events in their areas of expertise. Miele also expressly supports any employees who wish to take part in part-time further training on their own initiative. The company provides finan- cial support for accredited, part-time further training courses or degree pro- grammes. Forty-four employees made use of this option during the reporting period. 79  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Miele also relies on experienced employees to share their knowledge and expertise. As part of the Miele Mentoring Programme, experienced employees are matched with junior managers and specialists to pro- vide them with career guidance by offering advice, establishing contacts, assisting with project development and giving feedback. WIDE RANGE OF OPEN TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES [GRI 404-2] Open training remains an impor- tant supplementary part of the training and education opportunities offered at Miele. These options are geared towards all employees in Germany. Unlike the internal and external training options, these open training sessions are held during employees\\u2019 free time. Miele covers the cost of these sessions. In the business year 2019, exactly 2,691 employees took part. That number stood at just 1,086 in 2020. The decrease was because almost all of the planned sessions had to be cancelled in the spring of 2020 due to the pandemic. The sessions were shifted to digital learning formats for the autumn programme \\u2013 and participation figures rebounded. The pro- gramme saw a considerable shift during the reporting period, going from in-person sessions to mainly digital formats. COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATION Filling at least three out of four open man- agerial positions from within the company is one of Miele\\u2019s stated goals. Particular attention is therefore paid to promoting the development of managers. Employees who take on a managerial position for the first time are prepared extensively for their new role with the help of a binding qualifi- cation programme. Further opportunities for learning and gaining experience that focus on transferring practical experience and feedback are available to experienced managers. One new feature introduced in 2020 was the \\u201cVirtual Management\\u201d (\\u201cVir- tuell f\\u00fchren\\u201d) live online training series, which is offered for managers working from home. Agile management was another new topic introduced in 2020, debuting in the smart home segment. Twenty-six man- agers in that area spent approximately six months training for their new leadership role in the context of the agile transformation. The Miele Business Academy plays a key role in the company\\u2019s efforts to train and educate its managerial staff. Seminars are held in English, and participants come from all cor- ners of the Miele world. The Miele Business Academy now offers 19 different training and learning options for international man- agers with various levels of experience, covering key management topics and skills. The one hundredth participant successfully completed the \\u201cManagement & Leadership Compact\\u201d course in 2019. Fifty participants attended the six events held in this course in the calendar years 2019 and 2020 alone (equivalent to 494 days of participation). DIGITALISATION UNLOCKS ADVANCED FORMS OF TRAINING AND LEARNING All new apprentices and trainees have been equipped with mobile devices since September 2020. This allows them to use digital learning platforms and similar options on their own. The MLS (\\u201cMobile Learning in Smart Factories\\u201d) dig- ital learning platform was introduced for vocational training activities back in 2019. Apprentices can access specially prepared, company-specific learning content, allowing them to learn anytime, anywhere. This further enhances the quality of the training and education they receive. Thanks to these measures, Miele was able to continue to ensure the same solid, challenging types of vocational training in 2020, even amid the pandemic.

Miele views having a diverse international workforce as a valuable addition both on a human level and professionally. And it is precisely in a global company that diversity is also an impor- tant competitive factor to say the least. PROMOTING DIVERSITY, PREVENTING DISCRIMINATION than Germany. Citizens of Turkey, Greece, Italy and Poland accounted for the largest share. Employees with disabilities made up 6 percent of all Miele workers in Germany (in the business years 2019 and 2020). Miele participated in German Diversity Day once again in the reporting period. About 50 employees from eight coun- tries took part in this activity, which was held in May 2020. This time around, they presented their insights into diversity through a creative digital photo collage. used by women via the > \\u201cCrossMentoring OWL\\u201d network. There are also regular dialogue and networking formats, such as \\u201cWomen with Power of Attorney\\u201d (\\u201cFrauen in Vollmacht\\u201d) for people with these authorisations and additional specific groups like meetings of female engi- neers. As at the end of December 2019, women accounted for 22.3 percent of the German workforce. The figure for the year after that was 22.1 percent. Worldwide, women made up 29.7 percent of the staff at Miele as at 31 December 2020. accommodate this with its family-friendly working conditions. In November 2020, Miele launched a strategic project in Greece to fill more entry-level and managerial positions with women. Female workers accounted for 41 percent of the staff in Greece in 2020. [GRI 405-1] Miele aims to raise awareness throughout the company of the vast poten- tial lying in diverse life and work experiences, perspectives and values. The company phi- losophy, the Miele Code of Conduct and the company-wide agreement on the German General Equal Treatment Act form the Group-wide framework for cultivating diver- sity and equal opportunity and taking action against discrimination. The company has demonstrated its adherence to this idea towards external and internal audiences alike by obtaining > SA8000 certification and signing the Diversity Charter in 2012. In the business year 2020, 6.3 percent (2019: 6.0 percent) of Miele employees in Germany were citizens of a country other COMMITMENT TO FEMALE EMPLOYEES Furthering female talent is firmly rooted as a point of Miele\\u2019s corporate strategy in its own right. In keeping with this position, it is also a particular area of focus for the company\\u2019s diversity measures. Miele supports women\\u2019s careers through various concepts. Just like their male colleagues, every woman at Miele who is identified and designated as being especially talented receives a full spectrum of individual growth and development opportuni- ties. Alongside the internal mentoring programme, which matches talented individ- uals with an experienced Miele manager or specialist, those with high potential can also access external mentoring, which is primarily Increasing the number of women in manage- ment positions is a stated goal of the HR policy, both in Germany and internationally. A total of 11.3 percent of managerial positions in Germany and 24.4 percent of managerial positions worldwide were held by women at the end of 2020. Miele does not consider it appropriate to define a fixed quota for increasing the proportion of women in mana- gerial positions. Miele instead strives to recruit the most qualified candidate for each position that must be filled, regardless of gender. Female candidates displaying high potential are specifically supported and encouraged to set ambitious professional goals, as well as to keep pursuing these goals after having chil- dren, if they choose to do so.

In dual study programmes in Germany, women accounted for 21.3 percent that same year in technical fields and 41.7 percent in business fields. Supporting female employees plays a central role at Miele. 29.7% was the worldwide percentage of women in the overall Miele workforce in 2020. (As at 31 December 2020) New managers are trained individually, com- pleting a one-day training programme titled \\u201cLeading through Diversity\\u201d (\\u201cDiversity \\u2013 Vielfalt f\\u00fchren\\u201d). The goal of this programme is to spur efforts towards greater diversity in managers\\u2019 own teams and to tap into the potential that this diversity offers. NO DIFFERENCES IN THE SALARIES RECEIVED BY WOMEN AND MEN [GRI 405-2] Remuneration at Miele\\u2019s German sites takes place according to a person\\u2019s job and in keeping with collective agreements based on the framework pay agreement for the metal and electronics industry. Therefore, there are no differences in the remunera- tion of women and men at Miele. Merit pay is categorised and calculated strictly based on the specific task and actual performance and does not take unrelated criteria into account. Measures to ensure that employee pay does not differ based on gender or other diversity criteria are also in place at the com- pany\\u2019s international production sites. In the reporting period, Miele once again participated in the \\u201cWomen\\u2019s Career Index\\u201d project, which is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth. Each year, the initiative highlights companies that take targeted action to provide fair career opportu- nities to women. The company is also committed to promoting female junior professionals, apprentices and trainees. In 2020, women made up 9.7 percent of those enrolled in technical vocational training and 60.2 percent of commercial apprentice- 12.2% women in technical apprenticeships; 57.4% women in commercial apprenticeships in Germany in September 2020 in relation to vocational training and the dual study programmes as a whole.

Right back to the company\\u2019s founders, Miele has always been aware of its responsibility for the well- being of employees and their families. A wide-ranging social engagement initiative has developed over the decades as a result of this care. Activities are largely focused on the regions surrounding the company sites. In this way, Miele helps to maintain a smooth-running, attractive environment. social engagement that apply to the sales sub- sidiaries chart the fundamental course for this. For example, the only donations permitted are to non-profit or charitable organisations. The responsible parties at the sales subsidiaries identify suitable projects themselves. Miele is in close communication with local communi- ties at all its locations and therefore has a good understanding of their needs. Miele wishes to be a reliable partner for the local authorities, associations and initiatives. With this in mind, it aims to support projects on a long-term basis, wherever possible. In special cases, this engagement, which is focused on continuity, is supplemented by flexible, short-term support. \\u20ac 175,000 \\u20ac were used for donations in 2020. In 2019, the Miele Foundation took part in social projects and initiatives amounting to around 97,000 euros. In 2020, the donation volume was much lower, at 50,000 euros, since many events were can- celled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. SUPPORTING FAMILIES Supporting and improving the oppor- tunities of young people from the areas surrounding the Miele sites has always been a key aspect of Miele\\u2019s social engagement. ENGAGEMENT BY THE COMPANY AND THE MIELE FOUNDATION Miele\\u2019s social activities are aimed at sup- porting youth and families and at education and culture. This applies not only to Miele as a company, but also to the foundation of the same name, which was established in 1974. While the explicit development goal of the Miele Foundation\\u2019s charter is the pro- motion of public welfare in the German city of G\\u00fctersloh, the company itself addresses a broader range of needs and also pursues active social engagement at other plant sites. The international sales subsidiaries also engage in diverse initiatives. The guidelines on FOCUSING ON SUSTAINABILITY Miele takes a very broad view of sustainability, in line with the 17 Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations. The international sales subsidi- aries also engage in extremely diverse and sustainable initiatives. For example, Miele partnered with three artists in Switzerland in 2020 to stand against disposable \\u201cfast fashion\\u201d. The campaign, dubbed \\u201cSame Shirt Different\\u201d, invited participants to upcycle existing articles of clothing, cushions or bags with iron-on patches using the Fashion- Master steam ironing system from Miele. DONATIONS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD [GRI 201-1, 415-1] Traditionally, Miele supports a number of regional charities with an annual donation of money or items. The projects to be supported are decided upon by the respon- sible division depending on the urgency and requirements of the requests. Large donations need to be approved by the Executive Board. In the business year 2018/19, Miele & Cie. KG donated a total of 175,000 euros in Germany. In the business year 2020, which now matches the calendar year, approximately 175,000 euros in funding was used for dona- tion purposes again. Since 1976, the Miele Foundation has offered significant financial support to the G\\u00fcter- sloh Holiday Games for children between the ages of 5 and 17. Every year, this oppor- tunity includes many different and various activities that provide care during school holidays. Support for the project \\u201cJugend- integration durch Sport\\u201d (integrating young people through sport) is also provided through an annual donation. This pro- ject was launched by the department for children and youth development in the city of G\\u00fctersloh in 2009. It aims to pro- mote social skills in young people that are rarely gained from usual sporting activity. Activities include hip-hop courses for girls or mixed indoor football, for example. 83  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES HR management Occupational health and safety Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Social engagement Since 2014, the company has supported the G\\u00fctersloh Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children with its \\u201cHand in Hand\\u201d family mentors project. In this project, volun- tary female family mentors visit families for a few hours each week to support the chil- dren and parents in difficult times. In 2019, 24 families received support from 24 men- tors in all. The figure for 2020 was 22 families. DIGITALISATION AND SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION STRENGTHENING CULTURAL OPPORTUNITIES Diverse cultural opportunities contribute sig- nificantly to making a region attractive and increasing the local quality of life. Therefore, an important element of Miele\\u2019s engagement has traditionally been to promote culture. In this reporting period, the company once again supported the Westf\\u00e4lische Kammerphil- harmonie ensemble, which is composed of members of well-known German orchestras, independent musicians and especially qualified students, an approach that stands out from the rest of the German orchestra landscape. To comply with its regional responsibili- ties, Miele also supports the digital transition through initiatives such as the \\u201cDigitale Agenda G\\u00fctersloh\\u201d and its first digitalisa- tion strategy. This project is among the \\u201cSmart Cities Made in Germany\\u201d model pro- jects. As part of the initiative, the German federal government provides about 8.5 million euros in funding to support for- ward-looking projects in G\\u00fctersloh, out of a total volume of about 13 million euros. Like in previous years, Miele supported Kulturgemeinschaft Dreiecksplatz, an associ- ation that organises various cultural events in G\\u00fctersloh, in both 2019 and 2020. In August 2020, an event called \\u201cKlangwandel\\u201d was launched as a partnership between Kultur- gemeinschaft Dreiecksplatz and three other organisers. In the project, sound collages were created in public spaces by art- ists who would normally have appeared on an open-air stage in G\\u00fctersloh this year. A significant objective of Miele\\u2019s involvement in education is to inspire children and young people to get involved in technology and to introduce young adults to technical profes- sional fields. In the reporting period, Miele supported non-profit association \\u201cDas erste Buch e.V.\\u201d, which aims to foster and sup- port a culture of reading among children and teens while cultivating their creativity and self-confidence. Schoolchildren in G\\u00fcters loh wrote exciting stories as part of the pro- ject. A panel of judges selected the top entries, which were published in a collected volume with financial support from Miele. DONATIONS TO EASE THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE In response to the devastating wildfires in January 2020, employees of the sales subsidiary in Australia col- lected donations for a number of aims: to care for wildlife, restore destroyed habitats, and promote ecot- ourism in the affected areas. Many employees used social media to highlight the campaign for the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia (WWF-Australia), which col- lected funds equivalent to nearly 34,000 euros in all.

At the same time, the scope covered by the key figures with regard to the participations and sales subsidiaries was changed. More information can be found in the respective footnotes. Due to these changes, the values for the calendar years 2019 and 2020 are of limited comparability with those of earlier business years. As a result, this report only presents the key figures for the past two calendar years.

The decline was primarily attributable to a reluctance to invest due to the uncertainties associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Over half of the total amount was invested in product development and in the expansion, conversion and modernisation of the international Miele Group production network. Miele also opened new flagship stores (Miele Experience Centers) at its sites in Sydney, Brussels and Sao Paolo, among others. These efforts were rounded out by the completion of the Miele Lounge at Munich\\u2019s Allianz Arena.

In G\\u00fctersloh, use of a stainless steel welding system also started, enhancing the level of vertical integration and leading to the creation of more stainless steel scrap. Lehrte saw investments in infrastructure, resulting in significant quantities of waste from excavated soil. In Uni\\u010dov, the ramp-up of a wash cabinet production process for dishwashers also led to an increase in metal scrap, which had a marked effect on the amount of waste. 1) The waste disposal method was determined on the basis of information provided by the waste disposal provider.

Moreover, the new plant in Poland was taken into account in the recording of data for the first time in 2020. Another reason for the increased water consumption is the dry summer and the necessary watering of green spaces as a result. 1) Water consumption is measured using water meters and taken from the energy reports from the energy management system. 2) Rainwater which is stored in cisterns or other similar containers and fed into a separate water system.

According to the location-based method, the values for the business year 2019 stood at 132,018 tonnes of CO2-equivalent and 128,646 tonnes of CO2-equivalent for 2020. The emission factors for 2019 from the German PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) were used to perform calculations in line with the location-based method. Alternatively, emission factors from the British Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) were also used. Total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions fell by 40 percent year on year in 2020. The decline in direct emissions (Scope 1) stood at 8 percent due to reduced natural gas and heating oil consumption, as well as the Covid-19-related reduction in mileage and the associated CO2 emissions of the company\\u2019s own vehicles. At 65 percent, the reduction in indirect emissions (Scope 2) was significantly higher, primarily as a result of the switch to green electricity. In 2020, 86 percent of the Miele locations worldwide covered their electricity needs with renewable energy. Moreover, electricity and district heat consumption fell further year on year across the Group. 1) The scope was expanded in 2019 to cover all production sites and sales subsidiaries, as well as the participations Steelco and Yujin. 2) Deviations of the total of the individual amounts from the entire figure in question are attributable to rounding. 3) Presentation of greenhouse gas emissions expanded from CO2 to CO2-equivalent, with CH4 and N20 being taken into account in addition to CO2 Emissions from volatile gases were considered irrelevant following a materiality analysis. 4) The calculation method used for the fleet was switched from the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to real consumption, with an uncertainty factor of 10 percent included for locations not previously taken into account.

Overall, their number increased by 4.2 percent compared to 30 June 2018, corresponding to a rise of 846 persons. Of that total, 299 came by way of the participations, which, with the exception of Steelco, were not part of the Miele Group in 2018. Steelco itself grew by 136 persons. Due to a combination of relocation and growth, new locations in Poland and the Netherlands were set up. Moreover, existing locations, such as the plant in Uni\\u010dov, saw substantial growth. As a result, the percentage of persons employed outside Germany increased from 46 to 47.2 percent.

CONTENTS 119119  Miele Sustainability Report 2021 MANAGEMENT & PROCESSES About this report Miele has been publishing sustainability reports since 2002. This report, the tenth of its kind, documents the compa- ny\\u2019s progress in line with the Miele sustainability strategy and the guiding principle \\u201cForever Better\\u201d. The objective of the 2021 report is to make the performance of the company in sustainability-related matters transparent to stakeholders such as sustainability experts, customers, employees and business partners. The content reflects the main sustaina- bility issues affecting the company. These issues were most recently identified in 2018 in the course of a materiality anal- ysis and were weighted according to their relevance for Miele. [GRI 102-54] Miele\\u2019s reporting on sustainability is geared towards the internationally recognised standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This report was prepared in accordance with the Core option of the GRI standards. To meet stakeholders\\u2019 needs for information optimally, the report also includes additional information. Refer- ences to the individual GRI indicators are associated with the key figures and the relevant passages in the text. The GRI content index is found at the end of this report. The structure of this report follows that of the preceding report, which was issued in 2019. Its four main chapters \\u2013 Management & processes, Products & services, Supply chain & production and Employees & society \\u2013 also reflect the fields of action and focal points of the Miele sustainability strategy, which was further refined during this reporting period. This makes it easier to see how the measures described in the subchapters contribute to meeting the strategic targets. PRODUCTS & SERVICES SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION [GRI 102-45/-50] Unlike the previous report, the Sustainability Report 2021 relates not to the last two business years at Miele (each of which ended on 30 June), but rather to the preceding calendar years. This is because the Miele busi- ness year was shifted to the calendar year in 2020. As a result, the reporting period runs from 1 January 2019 until 31 December 2020. Beyond that, key content from the second half of 2018 was also taken into account. The edito- rial deadline was in September 2021. Relevant occurrences noted by then were included in the report. Unless other- wise stated, all information, including key figures, refers to Miele & Cie. KG and its subsidiary Imperial-Werke oHG. This includes all German production and administrative sites, as well as sales and service in Germany. It also encom- passes \\u2013 under the umbrella of Miele Beteiligungs-GmbH \\u2013 the production sites in Bra\\u015fov (Romania), B\\u00fcrmoos (Austria), Dongguan (China), Ksawer\\u00f3w (Poland) and Uni\\u010dov (Czech Republic), along with the international sales subsidiaries. [GRI 102-10/-48/-49] During the reporting period, there were significant changes in relation to the size and > structure of the Group. A second washing machine plant com- menced operations in Ksawer\\u00f3w at the end of 2019, for example. The relocation of part of production operations from the B\\u00fcrmoos plant (manufacturing of medical products) to Steelco S.p.A., a subsidiary in Italy, was also concluded in 2019. In addition, the subsidiary Miele Venture Cap- ital GmbH acquired stakes in the following companies or increased its existing stakes in these companies during the reporting period: Agrilution Systems GmbH, MChef EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES Verwaltungs-GmbH and MChef GmbH & Co. KG, Miele Operations & Payment Solutions GmbH, WaschMal GmbH, KptnCook Corp., Plant Jammer ApS and loadbee GmbH. Miele Venture Capital GmbH and its subsidiaries and sharehold- ings, as well as Steelco S.p.A. and Yujin Robot Co., Ltd, are not yet fully reflected in this report except where noted sep- arately, such as in > the company profile and > key figures. The Miele Sustainability Report is available > online as a PDF file. A detailed listing of key figures appears in the \\u201cFacts & figures\\u201d section at the end of the report. The sustainability website also offers customers and the public at large an overview of the Miele sustainability philosophy and how it is put into practice. It is available at > www.miele.com/sustainability and via Miele.de or Miele.com. The use of the full legal forms throughout the text has been avoided for the sake of greater readability.

SUPPLY CHAIN & PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES & SOCIETY FACTS & FIGURES CONTENTS 121 \",\n          \"General information . Describe your business model (including business object, products/services) . For more than 30 years, the CVH Group, with its locations throughout Germany in Hanover, Hamburg, Berlin and Magdeburg, has been committed to providing fast, reliable supplies of basic and specialty chemicals. In addition, the focus is on application engineering consulting and the acquisition of usable residual materials. Two key criteria of our philosophy are to place people at the centre of our actions and sustainably deal with resources. Therefore, we participate in the Responsible Care Programme and have an energy management system. Economic decisions are made with regard to sustainability. Within this framework, each of our 120 employees is also committed to environmentally conscious action. In the 2018 financial year, an annual turnover of EUR 75 million was achieved.\\\"The success of our customers is our success and sustainability is a common success factor.\\\" . Additional remarks: . Energy Management 50001 The CVH Group has implemented an energy management system throughout the company and has successfully been certified in accordance with ISO 50001:2011. Responsible Care Responsible Care is a worldwide program for the safe handling of chemicals. The entire CVH Group has been participating in the Responsible Care program of the Chemical Trade Association for more than 20 years. ISO 9001:2015 The ongoing work on our certified QM system naturally also includes the constant adaptation to the current state of the standard, whether it be to the process-oriented revision in 2008 or to the upcoming risk-based version DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 (already carried out, current data available) ESAD II (European Single Assessment Document) This is a standardized catalogue of questions developed from the Resposible Care program. The catalogue of questions covers the topics of safety, health, environmental protection and quality. . 1. Strategic analysis and measures . The company discloses whether it pursues a sustainability strategy and explains what concrete measures it is taking to operate in accordance with the essential and recognised industry-specific, national and international standards. . Our initiative for sustainability covers the areas of social responsibility, environmental protection, health and product safety. From this we are currently developing a sustainability strategy. The goal of the CVH Group is to be the most sustainable chemical distributor in Germany. Social responsibility Compliance with the social standards is a matter of course and mandatory for all employees. CVH is committed to the preservation of ethics and morals. This includes compliance with statutory regulations and prohibitions as well as compliance with self-imposed codes of conduct (compliance) and competition law. But also a targeted development of employees and the creation of an optimal working environment are an essential part of our social responsibility. In addition, the CVH Group promotes projects for child care and youth care at home and abroad. Environmental protection Through conversions to more efficient products at our customers and the use of modern measuring and dosing technology, the use of chemicals can be significantly reduced. The associated saving of resources is another important contribution to protecting our environment. Health By switching to more efficient products and training our customers' staff in handling hazardous substances, we not only want to reduce the environmental impact as much as possible, but also to reduce potential sources of danger for individual employees when handling chemicals. Our modern fleet of vehicles also contributes to the safe transport of dangerous substances and the likelihood of an accident to a minimum. Product safety The safe handling of hazardous substances has always been an important concern of CVH and is constantly being pursued by the exchange of problematic hazardous substances with customers and the use of intelligent packaging solutions. This not only leads to a safe handling of chemicals, but can also lead to a higher security of supply in certain areas of application. In this way, legal requirements or limited capacities of producers are taken into account. . 2. Materiality . The company discloses which aspects of its own business activities have a significant impact on aspects of sustainability and the significant impact the aspects of sustainability have on its business activities. It analyses the positive and negative effects and indicates how these findings are incorporated into its own processes. . The concept of sustainability is firmly anchored in our company policy. Participation in the Responsible Care Programme of the German Chemical Trade Association (VCH) documents our self-contribution to a responsible handling of chemicals towards customers, suppliers, authorities and our fellow citizens, oriented towards safety and environmental protection. In the chemical trade there are not only opportunities that arise from our sustainability idea, but also risks in which one becomes more expensive by sustainable solutions to competitors to lose. Nevertheless, many possibilities arise from sustainable activities. Customers who are subject to the CSR reporting obligation of the EU can be bound to the company more closely. In addition, one can not gain sustainability from sustainability, e.g. customers their previous suppliers. Therefore, for us the opportunities that result from the sustainability aspect in relation to our business activities prevail. The following topics have influence on our business activities: logistics, product optimization, services and water treatment. Logistics In the area of logistics, we attach importance to environmentally friendly packaging solutions which can achieve packaging savings. This is realized by our deposit system. In addition, we are continuously working on a fleet optimization. Product optimization Product optimization includes, for example, the exchange of problematic hazardous materials by less dangerous products, an application-technical consulting regarding the use of chemicals, product training as well as the planning and installation of the ideal extraction technology for chemicals.ServicesWe support our customers in the proper utilization of the residual materials with the help of approved disposal partners and advise on all problems from the field of disposal. In addition, we take back contaminated solvents for recycling within the framework of the circular management law.Water treatmentThe focus of water treatment is on saving fresh water by treating waste and cooling water and using modern measuring, dosing and control technology. . Product management; employee training/further training; customer loyalty; data protection/data security; behaviour compliant with law and guidelines; revenue management; stakeholder dialogue; responsible management of resources . Objectives . The company discloses which qualitative and/or quantitative as well as time-defined sustainability goals are set and operationalized and how their level of achievement is controlled. . The CVH Group is committed to implementing a sustainability initiative in sales and procurement. This means in concrete terms that an 8% reduction in energy consumption between 2016 and 2020 (each year 2%) is to be achieved. In addition, the energy management system DIN:ISO 50001 aims to determine savings potentials, whose implementation and costs are to be examined and, if necessary, implemented. Our fleet is up to date. We only use new generation trucks with Euro 6 engines. Reducing fleet consumption and emissions is an important point in terms of our sustainability goals. All trucks have installed the so-called Fleetboard system from Mercedes. This system is used for efficient tour planning and also enables an operational analysis. Based on this application analysis, the driving behaviour can be evaluated monthly. The system awards grades of 1-10 and evaluates, among other things, predictive driving, wear and fuel consumption. Our sustainability initiative is also based on the United Nations Agenda 2030. With the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, however, wholesalers do not have a direct influence on all of these goals. However, with the choice of our suppliers and customers, we contribute to these goals in terms of sustainability and support through sponsorships in cooperation with the organization Plan International Children in developing countries. In addition, we are committed, for example, to promoting associations in the region. Our sustainability goals are basically controlled by our management. Nevertheless, every employee is committed to controlling himself and his colleagues. In addition, internal and external audits on certifications such as Responsible Care, ISO 50001:2011, SQAS/ ESAD II, ISO 9001:2015 ensure independent strategic control of our set sustainability goals. . 4. Depth of the value chain . The company specifies the importance of sustainability aspects for value creation and to what depth of its value chain sustainability criteria are reviewed. . The value chain of CVH Chemie-Vertrieb GmbH & Co. Hannover KG is characterized by the supply of basic and special chemicals to customers. We meet special requirements with our services. Through the personal contact of the customer managers with the customers, topics such as procurement, quality, supply security, individual problem solutions as well as application technical questions can be clarified. The responsibility of our company extends according to the thought of the Responsible Care from the procurement to the use phase up to its controlled disposal. In principle, the principle of sustainable development is anchored in the integrated management manual. Supportingly, processes, procedures and work instructions describe responsible and sustainable action. The requirements are applied in the corporate divisions and continuously intensified. Problems regarding sustainability in business relations with customers or suppliers are openly communicated and solved by our customer managers/purchaser and sales representatives in cooperation. In addition, external and internal audits identify problems and dangers and solve them together. The value chain includes: Contact with the customer: Requirements for the product such as quality, price and date, End-of-life declarations Procurement, service and sales: Core processes and thus the central business of CVH, selection of responsible manufacturers and suppliers, monitoring of the supply chain with regard to the environment, production conditions and transport routes, testing and selection of an appropriate service provider taking into account the feasibility and costs, consideration of aspects such as responsible care, environmental aspects of the customer as well as legal requirements for storage and handling hazardous substances, transmission of product specifications, safety data sheets, analysis certificates or factory certificates Logistics: through own fleet or external freight forwarders, through load records of trucks and fleetboard systems, the emissions associated with delivery are improved and minimized Recovery and disposal of chemicals: professional disposal and recycling taking into account environmental protection Building management: ongoing optimisation of energy efficiency Concrete goals and measures are defined by performance indicators and tracked and evaluated by the QS circle. Through the publication of the Responsible Annual Report, we pass on our understanding of consistency and the results of our suggestions to interested parties and customers. Internal and external audits as well as a complaint management serve as supporting processes for responsible and environmentally conscious action. Feedback in customer satisfaction analyses enables all business areas to be continuously improved and reoriented. . Performance indicators for criteria 1 to 4 . Vehicle fleet Consumption optimization by Fleetboard Application analysis . With regard to vehicle fleet consumption optimization, the driving behaviour is evaluated monthly. These evaluations raise our drivers' awareness of their driving behaviour and show them on a monthly basis where there is need for improvement. . Internal indicators . Services, waste . 5. Responsibility . The responsibilities in corporate management for sustainability are disclosed. . The responsibility lies with the management or with the management in the locations, i.e. at the top management level. The sustainability program was also initiated by the management. Nevertheless, every employee of the CVH Group is committed to a sustainable and environmentally conscious action. For example, regular, internal training for the employees takes place. . 6. Rules and processes . The company discloses how the sustainability strategy is implemented through rules and processes in the operational business. . Chemie-Vertrieb GmbH & Co. Hannover KG has implemented its sustainability and corporate strategy in the form of process instructions into the ongoing business process. The integrated quality management system according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 ensures that all processes are documented and adapted if necessary. Regular internal quality management training/meetings for employees ensure that everyone involved in the business process can contribute their concerns to this system in order to continuously improve it. In addition, the Responsible Care Initiative of the chemical industry is an important basis for all business processes. This system is regularly reviewed both through internal and external audits. This ensures continuous further development, including environmental protection and work safety. Another important cornerstone of our sustainability strategy is the responsible use of resources. In the course of this, an energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001:2011 was implemented in the whole CVH group and in 2018 the most current energy management system according to DIN EN ISO 50001:2015 was introduced. Also, the use of a modern fleet and an efficient supply rhythm of our customers helps to save energy and reduces CO emissions to a large extent. Thus, not only resources are spared, but also the negative ecological effects are significantly minimized. The CVH group is also in a continuous improvement process. In addition, employees are stopped for waste separation and paper saving. . 7. Control . The company discloses how and which performance indicators are used for sustainability in regular internal planning and control. It explains how appropriate processes ensure reliability, comparability and consistency of data for internal control and external communication. . Energy demand divided by truck, passenger car, heating energy and electricity; emissions of CO2 emissions (by fleet); waste divided by hazardous and non-hazardous waste related to seizure at the customer; regular employee satisfaction analysis; accidents at work and resulting missing days; end-of-life declarations; employee training (training needs analysis) . Performance indicators on sustainability : Further performance indicators such as fluctuation rate and disease rate are also used for corporate controlling. In addition, the CVH Group regularly conducts internal and external audits, e.g.: DIN EN ISO 50001:2015, DIN EN ISO 9001:2015, Responsible Care, SQAS and Fami QS. . Performance indicators for criteria 5 to 7 . Performance Indicator G4-56 Describe the values, principles and standards of conduct and conduct (codes of conduct and ethics) of the organization. . CVH is aware of corporate social responsibility. Respect for human rights, fair working conditions, equal rights, equal opportunities and non-discrimination are guidelines for our business activities. CVH ensures that when selecting its suppliers, they are equally committed to these principles. CVH is committed to ensuring compliance with social standards. In Germany, corresponding laws and legislation, including the ban on the employment of children, the protection of working young people, the prohibition of forced labour, working time restrictions, freedom of association (e.g. of workers' organisations), occupational safety and equal opportunities, are regulated. Compliance with these regulations is a matter of course for the CVH Group and its employees operating in Germany and can be checked at any time by customers, suppliers or authorities. CVH is committed to the preservation of ethics and morals in business life and requires its employees to always act in accordance with the applicable law as well as the company's internal guidelines. This includes compliance with all legal regulations and prohibitions, the protection of business secrets and data protection, as well as compliance with self-imposed codes of conduct and competition law. CVH also requires its suppliers to feel obliged to these values. . Incentive schemes . The company discloses how the target agreements and remuneration for managers and employees are also oriented towards achieving sustainability goals and long-term value creation. It is disclosed to what extent the achievement of these goals is part of the evaluation of the top management level (CEO/CEO) by the supervisory board. . Sustainability is not yet a fixed or explicitly mentioned component in the target agreements and remunerations of our employees in the office. However, it is assumed that it is. Most importantly, commercial indicators are currently an indicator of the target agreements. Most of our employees receive a basic salary with a variable salary share that is oriented towards the raw profit. Cost savings can be achieved through efficient planning of tours and goods deliveries. This has a positive effect on the variable salary and thus represents an incentive for sustainable action. With our trucks drivers we have created a direct incentive. These receive premiums for a particularly efficient and predictive driving method. Driving is carried out with Fleetboard, a system that provides information on consumption, service life and braking behaviour, among other things. In addition, there is a non-monetary system. By commending the driving style of our drivers in monthly discussions, a motivational increase is achieved, which leads to our drivers continuously improving. The achievement of our sustainability goals is controlled by the shareholders at the advisory board meetings. The management of the CVH Group is obliged to submit an annual report to the advisory board. This report also addresses, among other things, the sustainability goals and certifications. Furthermore, the achievement of the goals is controlled by annual internal and external audits (e.g. ISO 50001:2011, ISO 2015:9001, Responsible Care). . Performance indicators for criterion 8 . Performance Indicator G4-51a Compensation Policy \\u2013 Report on the remuneration policy for the highest supervisory body and senior executives. . The highest supervisory body (advisory board) does not receive any remuneration. Like all other employees, the executives participate in the company's overall result via a variable salary share. . Performance Indicator G4-54 Specify the ratio of the annual remuneration of the highest paid employee in each country with significant business activities to the average level (median) of the total annual remuneration of all employees (excluding the highest paid employee) in the same country. . No figures are currently collected for this, as so far not relevant. . 9. Participation of Stakeholder Groups . The company discloses how social and economically relevant stakeholders are identified and integrated into the sustainability process. It discloses whether and how a continuous dialogue with them is maintained and how its results are integrated into the sustainability process. . Economically relevant stakeholders are identified with the help of the quality management system. These include: - suppliers (certificates, audits) - customers (audits, final declarations) - employees - promotion of regional associations Gl\\u00fccksmesse e.V. - godmother - customer surveys - supplier discussions In dialogue with these stakeholders, an evaluation of e.g. suppliers - and customer surveys takes place regularly. In addition, during customer visits as well as supplier audits, the topic of sustainability in cooperation is discussed in principle, documented in reports and subsequently kept up with the resulting activities (CVH Initiative for Sustainability). In the course of changing market conditions, product and service developments as well as legal requirements, we see the further development of sustainability management as a continuous process. . Performance indicators for criterion 9 . Performance Indicator G4-27 Name the most important issues and concerns that have arisen through stakeholder involvement and how the organisation has responded to those important issues and concerns, including through reporting. Name the stakeholder groups that have addressed the key issues and concerns. . In cooperation with our customers, the topic of delivery bundling has arisen. The reason for this was isolated complaints about too high traffic volumes. For this reason, we also try to optimize the number of deliveries with other customers. Through regular customer satisfaction analyses, supplier surveys and employee satisfaction analyses, our stakeholders have the opportunity to inform us of their concerns. . 10. Innovation and product management . The company discloses how it contributes through appropriate processes to improving the sustainability of its own resource use and users through innovations in products and services. It also explains whether and how their current and future impact is assessed in the value chain and in the product lifecycle for the essential products and services. . As a wholesale trade, the main resource consumption results from buildings, vehicles and internal processes (e.g. IT) as well as indirectly from the product range. In order to create conditions for higher energy efficiency, modern, resource-efficient building and vehicle technology is continuously invested. In the course of this development, e.g. all illuminants were replaced by energy-saving LED bulbs. Each employee is encouraged by proper ventilation and heating to continuously minimize the gas consumption. Due to the economical handling of paper (bead-side printing, unused printed paper as a note/lubrication slip) paper wastes are to be avoided. Innovative fleetboard systems in the trucks as well as well thought-out route planning are to achieve an efficient and environmentally friendly driving method. An important aspect is the use of innovative packaging techniques (IBC, Safe-Tainer, etc.) that ensure the safe transport of chemicals. We take over the reliable distribution, bottling, storage and safe transport for the closed circuit systems with special double-walled safety containers (fass-in-container system). They enable an emission-free transfer of chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons for the sustainable protection of man and the environment. Thanks to our sustainable deposit system, all containers are pawned, subjected to cleaning after use and reused. In the Metaclean area, products are developed for special requirements and applications of our customers. Care is taken to ensure that the products are manufactured under the globally recognized safety and environmental standards. In dialogue with our business partners, sustainable development plays an important role for us along the value chain. It is very important to us that we work with our customers GEMEINSAM for a sustainable development of our business relationship. We do not come with a finished solution \\\" X\\\" instead optimizes our business in cooperation. Through an active cooperation and the common interest to make it as sustainable as possible, we help our customers, for example, to exchange dangerous products for their employees through harmless alternatives or special formulations. Through efficient tour planning in cooperation with our customers' buyers, it is also possible to bundle journeys, so that there are no routes for small quantities of goods. In the course of Responsible Care, the areas such as occupational health and health protection, environmental protection and transport safety are consolidated and improved by regular training and training. . Performance indicators for criterion 10 . Performance indicator G4-FS11 Percentage of financial assets subject to a positive or negative selection test according to environmental or social factors. . Financial investments are carried out exclusively at our parent companies. . 11. Utilization of natural resources . The company discloses the extent to which natural resources are used for business activities, including materials as well as the input and output of water, soil, waste, energy, area, biodiversity and emissions for the life cycle of products and services. . \\\"Sustainability as a common success factor.\\\" According to our sustainability initiative, we not only want to talk about this, but also integrate this idea firmly into all business processes. Our consumption consists of the use of electricity, gas and water for our office activities, as well as diesel and petrol as fuel for our own transporting truck fleet and external sales. With the introduction and certification of energy management according to DIN:ISO50001:2011, the above-mentioned consumptions and the associated CO emissions per location are recorded and evaluated. This ensures the necessary transparency with the problem zones can be optimized. Our goal is to continuously improve energy efficiency or reduce consumption. In the annual training sessions, employees are regularly sensitized with regard to the correct use of resources and are called upon to participate in process and process improvement. The behaviour, participation and schools of our employees are another key factor for continuous improvement. The CVH Group sells a wide range of basic and specialty chemicals. When selecting suppliers, particular attention is paid to manufacturing processes. This is to be done as energy-efficiently and sustainably as possible. These points are controlled by regular audits. In the context of Responsible Care, the CVH Group is obliged to analyse and minimize negative influences in the various processes of the value chain. This is also supported by our QM system. . 12. Resource management . The Company shall disclose the qualitative and quantitative objectives it has set for its resource efficiency, in particular the use of renewable energies, the increase in raw material productivity and the reduction of the use of ecosystem services, the measures and strategies it pursues, how they have been or are to be fulfilled in the future and where it sees risks. . CVH is committed to a sustainable energy policy and is committed to continuously reducing energy consumption, especially in the areas of passenger cars/trucks and buildings, as well as the associated CO emissions, in compliance with the statutory requirements. In order to achieve these goals, an energy management system DIN:ISO50001 was introduced together with the CG Group in the framework of a matrix certification. The reduction of the energy index (kWh/to warehouse sales) and the absolute values of electricity and natural gas across groups by 2020 has been reduced by 8%, in relation to 2015. In addition, the CVH Group strives for a continuous annual improvement of 2% in the procurement of the resources electricity and gas. In addition, special attention is paid to the origin (100% eco-electricity). Water consumption is limited to the one in the office building, as the CVH Group has no own production. Risks resulting from the business activities of our products and services are recorded in a risk management system annually reviewed and updated! Since we have no own production result the only risks from our transport business. . Performance indicators for criteria 11 to 12 . Performance indicator G4-EN1 Materials used by weight or volume. . No production takes place at our locations. Our suppliers take over the production, so no information can be provided on this. . Performance indicator G4-EN3 Energy consumption within the organisation. . - electricity consumption - electricity source 100% green electricity - fuel car / truck - gas consumption (heating) . Performance indicator G4-EN6 Reduction of energy consumption. . The goal is to reduce total energy consumption across groups by 8% by 2020, relative to 2015. All energy sources listed under the G4-EN3 power indicator are determined and evaluated quarterly. 2015: 3,365.259 kW/h 2018: 2,875.730 kW/h This results in a reduction of 14,55%. . Performance indicator G4-EN8 Total water abstraction by source. . At this time, there is no determination of the annual water consumption. The water consumption in the CVH group refers only to the operation of the sanitary installations and the collection of employees e.g. in kitchens. This water comes from the regional drinking water network. . Performance indicator G4-EN23 Total weight of waste by type and method of disposal. . There is no survey of the total weight of the waste, since it is only office waste that is handed over to the regional disposers. . 13. Climate-related emissions . The company discloses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol or standards based on it and sets its own emission reduction targets. . In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, there are two main emission sources in the CVH Group. Our fleet and the emissions generated in our locations with the consumption of gas and electricity. In the sense of our certified energy management system according to DIN:ISO50001:2011, the consumption of vehicles is recorded and the associated CO emissions per location are recorded and evaluated. This applies to all our vehicles trucks and cars. All trucks in the CVH Group fleet have installed the latest Euro 6 engines. In the new acquisition of vehicles, attention is also paid to the fact that each new vehicle emits less climate-relevant emissions than the predecessor. The emissions that occur in the sense of business activities in our offices are limited to the consumption of electricity and gas and the resulting output. CVH receives 100% green electricity from a local energy supplier. In order to reduce long-term electricity consumption, as possible all bulbs in LED lamps were changed in 2018. . Performance indicators for criterion 13 . Performance indicator G4-EN15 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1). . CO emissions are determined by the analysis of fuel consumption of cars/lorries, electricity consumption and the consumption of gas for heating systems. 2015: 1434 tonnes CO 2018: 1312 tonnes CO This corresponds to a reduction of 8.51% . G4-EN16 Indirect energy related GHG emissions (Scope 2). . For this purpose, the CVH Group does not collect any data, since the business activity only requires electricity, gas and water for the office and warehouse buildings. Thus, no above-average consumptions such as in industrial plants occur. The CVH Group obtains eco-electricity from regional energy suppliers. . Performance indicator G4-EN17 Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). . The CVH group does not collect data for this purpose (see: G4-EN16). . Performance indicator G4-EN19 Reduction of GHG emissions. . A continuous reduction of GHG emissions is one of our goals. For this purpose, data on consumption and associated GHG emissions are collected within the framework of the energy management system ISO:50001. See G4-EN6 & G4-EN15 performance indicator. . 14. Workers' rights . The company reports on how it complies with nationally and internationally recognised standards on employee rights and promotes the participation of employees in the company and in the company's sustainability management, which goals it sets itself, which results have been achieved so far and where it sees risks. . Respect for workers' rights is a fundamental issue in the philosophy of the CVH Group and is enshrined in our internal code of conduct. The CVH Group only operates nationally and respects the ILO core labour standards. Therefore, employees also get more holidays than is required by law. Through audit mechanisms of the integrated management system, it is ensured that all workers' rights are respected. In order to be able to compete, we need motivated and competent employees who work with our company. The satisfaction of the employees plays a decisive role in this, because employees who are placed in a positive position over their tasks make full use of their performance potential and thus ensure the long-term success of the CVH Group. The results of the employee satisfaction analyses serve as the basis for the introduction of suitable measures to improve employee satisfaction. The sensitization of the employees to the sustainability idea takes place in regular meetings. The risk of a fluctuation of well-trained employees goes in the CVH Group towards zero. . 15. Equal opportunities . The company discloses how it implements national and international processes and what goals it has to promote equal opportunities and diversity, occupational safety and health protection, participation, integration of migrants and people with disabilities, adequate pay and agreement of family and work, and how it implements them. .

Legal requirements are implemented and, in addition, - following the idea of Responsible Care - brought to the state of the art. Through targeted investments, we want to ensure maximum operational and occupational safety and to act economically sustainable. In order to promote the health of our employees, every employee can use free sports offers in a nearby fitness studio. The CVH Group pays all employees over-tariff. Every employee can participate in the company's development via a variable salary share. For our management, the principle that every employee in the company contributes significantly to the company's success is clear from our commission model. Reconciliation of family and work is very important to the CVH Group. By means of a working time model that allows half-day work, parental leave and an effortless transition back to full-day work, this is possible. In addition, the CVH Group attaches great importance to equality and the employment of people with disabilities. . (ii) the need to improve the quality of training; . The company discloses the objectives it has set and the measures it has taken to promote employability, i.e. the ability to participate in the working and professional world of all employees, and to adapt it to demographic trends, and where it sees risks. .
