The patient was first diagnosed with urethra adenocarcinoma 8 years ago. Total resection of the urinary bladder with lymphatic dissection was performed followed by combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One and a half-year after the first operation the patient was reoperated on for metastasis of the urethral adenocarcinoma and vulvectomy with left inguinal radical lymph node dissection was performed. The pathology report was in compliance with the first report of the urethral adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy. At the end of the same year the patient suffered a mass in her right thigh that caused a suspicion of another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy was performed and pathology specimens revealed malignant mesenchymal tumor. 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy was applied due to close neighbourhood of the tumor to the femoral artery and the tumor being larger than 5 centimeters in diameter. Following preoperative radiotherapy, wide resection of the tumor was performed. The pathology reports showed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma. The oncology consultation did not recommend postoperative chemotherapy, but 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy was applied.\\\\nFor the next three years the patient was regularly followed and no evidence of local or systemic relapse was present. The patient quit the routine control examinations and could not be followed until 4 months ago when MRI evaluation was performed for a mass in her left thigh. A subcutaneous lesion was detected in the left thigh with typical features of a lipoma. In addition, a large mass in the right femur was coincidentally observed with a satellite cutaneous nodule close to the previous incision scar (Figures and ). Tru-cut biopsy and PET scan were performed to grade the new lesion. The tru-cut biopsy has reported a low grade periosteal chondral tumor. An apical lesion of the right lung which was thought to be a metastasis was also present. MRI and CT angiographic evaluation showed the soft tissue component of the tumor enclosing the bone lesion 180 degrees medially and also involving a 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein ().\\\\nThe patient was reoperated on. Wide resection for the metastatic nodule of the skin was performed first and the frozen pathology reported it as a malignant mesenchymal tumor. The tumor of the right femur was also removed with wide resection including the involved 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein in the Hunter canal (). Frozen pathology results reported clean margins and the lesion being possibly periosteal chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The femoral artery and vein were reconstructed using saphenous vein from the left leg. Saphenous vein of the right leg was not used in order not to disturb both venous drainage systems of the same leg and to avoid a possible venous insufficiency postoperatively. The 22 cm long bony defect was reconstructed using a massive allograft of femur and plate-screw fixation of the proximal and distal osteotomy sites was performed following locked intramedullary nailing (). The docking sites were grafted with 10 cc of demineralized bone matrix each. Pathologic evaluation revealed the mass of the right femur to be a juxtacortical chondroblastic osteosarcoma and the soft tissue mass anterior to it to be an indifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the latter being in compliance with a relapse of the pleomorphic mesenchymal tumor that was resected in 2008. Pathologic evaluation of the resected dumbbell-shaped lesion of the left thigh revealed angiolipoma.\\\\nThroughout the routine radiologic evaluations and PET scan before surgery, a lesion in the right lung was also detected and was reported as a metastatic lesion (). Three weeks after the last surgery, thoracoscopy assisted wedge resection of the metastatic lesion was planned. At this time, the frozen biopsy displayed a primary adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung and the patient underwent a lobectomy.\",\n          \"An 8-year-old male neutered Domestic Long Hair cat was presented for a rapidly growing left ventral cervical mass. The mass was first noted 3 weeks prior to presentation, and fine needle aspiration and cytology performed by the primary care veterinarian was suggestive of lymphoma. At the time of presentation, the cat had no clinical signs associated with the large mass. The owner reported that 7 months prior, there was a similar growth on the opposite side of the neck, which, after an inconclusive cytology, resolved with empirical antibiotic and steroid treatment. The cat had no other pertinent past medical history besides occasional upper respiratory signs from suspected feline herpesvirus infection.\\\\nPhysical examination revealed a left ventral cervical mass (6.0 cm \\u00d7 3.9 cm), which was suspected to be an enlarged medial retropharyngeal lymph node. No other enlarged lymph nodes were detected on palpation. A grade 2/6 left-sided systolic heart murmur was also noted. Initial complete blood count and chemistry panel revealed no significant findings, and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)/Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) SNAP test were negative. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. An echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were recommended for further staging and to evaluate the extent of cardiac disease prior to general anesthesia but declined by the owner. Fine needle aspiration and cytology of the cervical mass revealed an expansion of large lymphocytes (~50%) with 50% small well-differentiated lymphocytes. There was also mild to moderate mixed inflammation (mild neutrophilic, moderate macrophagic). It is worthy to note that there was a lack of expansion of intermediate lymphocytes. These findings were concerning for lymphoma. Additional pertinent cytologic findings included mild plasma cell hyperplasia and mild to moderate mixed inflammation characterized by non-degenerate neutrophils and macrophages. Given the prolonged history of masses confined to the cervical region and cytology demonstrating persistence of a significant small lymphocyte population and mixed inflammation within the affected lymph node, Hodgkin's-like lymphoma was considered as a differential diagnosis in addition to high-grade lymphoma, despite the lack of characteristic Reed\\u2013Sternberg cells.\\\\nCross-sectional imaging was recommended to stage and plan for potential surgical removal of the cervical mass. Case timeline is presented in . The next day, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed under sedation (0.2 mg/kg butorphanol IV and 1.5 mg/kg alfaxalone IV), using a multidetector, 64-slice CT (GE Revolution EVO, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), at 120 kVp in a transverse plane (1.25-mm slice thickness) with pre-contrast and post-contrast imaging with 10 ml (240 mgI/ml) of iohexol administered IV. The scan included the skull, cervical region, and the cranial thorax. The CT showed a 4.1 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm \\u00d7 4.4 cm ovoid, hypoattenuating, heterogeneously and peripherally contrast enhancing soft tissue mass in the left ventral neck, causing rightward deviation of the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, and ventrolateral deviation of the left jugular vein. The mass was assumed to be the left medial retropharyngeal lymph node, as it was not seen otherwise. There was also enlargement, rounding, and contrast enhancement of the left superficial cervical lymph node (1.0 cm in diameter). Other findings from the CT included right caudal rhinitis and bilateral otitis media.\\\\nA full-body positron emission tomography\\u2013computed tomography (PET/CT) was performed to assess the extent of local and distant disease the following week. PET/CT was recommended in addition to CT for the cat to obtain more sensitive staging information prior to surgical lymph node extirpation, especially due to the additional enlarged left superficial cervical lymph node noted on CT. The cat was premedicated with butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IV); general anesthesia was induced with propofol (4 mg/kg IV) and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen delivered via a circle anesthetic breathing system. The cat was placed in prone position. Blood glucose prior to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) injection was 102 mg/dl. A dose of 9.25 MBq/kg (0.25 mCi/kg IV) of 18F-FDG was administered to the cat. The list mode time-of-flight raw data were acquired continuously on the Gemini 64 TF with Astonish (Philips, Cleveland, Ohio) PET/CT system. Two-millimeter isotropic voxel data sets [288 \\u00d7 288 matrix size using a 576 mm field of view (FOV)] and 180 s/bed were reconstructed using time-of-flight, three iterations, and 11 subsets. CT was acquired using the multi-slice system at 120 kVp and 150 mAs and reconstructed with a 4-mm slice thickness (512 \\u00d7 512 matrix size using 600 mm FOV) for attenuation correction and coregistration. A dynamic acquisition was performed over the body region starting with the 18F-FDG administration followed by a whole-body PET at 75 min post injection. The Philips Intellispace Portal was used to generate the images for subsequent case review and semi-quantitative assessment.\\\\nPET/CT () showed multiple enlarged 18F-FDG-avid lymph nodes (SUVmax left medial retropharyngeal 31.0; right medial retropharyngeal 4.5; left caudal cervical 19.5) and nodal masses in the neck, in addition to multiple 18F-FDG-avid regions in both lungs (SUVmax 4.4 and 6.8) and the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUVmax 10.6 and 17.6). There were single soft tissue nodules with focal surrounding unstructured interstitial opacities in the caudal lungs bilaterally which were not appreciated on the thoracic radiographs performed prior. The small bowel had a 18F-FDG-avid soft tissue nodule. The liver had multiple hypoattenuating lesions that were 18F-FDG-avid (SUVmax 17.9), and both renal cortices had multiple foci of abnormally increased 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax left kidney 16.7, right kidney 15.0). The spleen had no associated abnormal 18F-FDG uptake. The nasal cavity and nasopharynx had linear 18F-FDG activity with no definite CT abnormality (SUVmax 8.3). As a non-specific finding, it was interpreted as possibly inflammatory or infectious disease, or malignant involvement of the nasal soft tissues and adjacent osseous structures. There was mild 18F-FDG-avid partial opacification of the ethmoid sinuses (SUVmax 4.4) attributed to the underlying inflammatory sinus disease.\\\\nGiven the multifocal nature of the disease found on PET/CT, surgery was not pursued, and chemotherapy was recommended. The cat was started on a CHOP-based protocol () (\\u2013). A complete blood count was performed before every treatment to assess for myelosuppression and determine if the cat could receive chemotherapy. A physical examination before the first dose of chemotherapy confirmed a static 6.0 cm \\u00d7 3.9 cm left retropharyngeal lymph node and mildly enlarged left superficial cervical lymph node. The cat received vincristine (0.6 mg/m2) IV and ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg) IV and went home on prednisolone (1.9 mg/kg) PO once daily. Maropitant, metronidazole, and ondansetron were prescribed on an as-needed basis.\\\\nThe following week, physical examination revealed favorable response to the treatment; the left retropharyngeal lymph node was reduced in size (3.2 cm \\u00d7 1.5 cm), although the left superficial cervical lymph node remained mildly enlarged. The cat was sedated (8 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine IV and 0.2 mg/kg butorphanol IV) for the administration of another dose of vincristine (0.6 mg/m2) IV, as well as an incisional biopsy of the left retropharyngeal lymph node, due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis from the previously performed fine needle aspirate. The biopsy was submitted for histopathologic evaluation at The Ohio State University.\\\\nThe submitted sections of lymph node had an invasive, non-encapsulated, highly cellular neoplasm composed of sheets resting on collagenous stroma. On low power, the neoplasm had vague and indistinct outlines of nodules composed of fibrous connective tissue (, inset). Neoplastic cells were round, had distinct cell borders, had variable amounts of eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm, and had large, round to irregular nuclei with vesicular to finely stippled chromatin and one large, eosinophilic, distinct nucleoli (). Rare (less than five) cells had nuclei that appear to be bilobed or binucleated with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli (suspect Reed\\u2013Sternberg cells) (). Occasionally, neoplastic cells had a moderate amount of vacuolated cytoplasm or had little to no cytoplasm with a clear halo surrounding. Mitoses were 15 in 10 high-powered (400 \\u00d7) fields. There were rare pockets of small lymphocytes throughout the tissue section. A moderate number of neutrophils and histiocytes were interspersed throughout the neoplasm with multifocal regions of necrosis characterized by eosinophilic homogenous material admixed with pyknotic cellular debris.\\\\nThis biopsy was most consistent with a high-grade large-cell lymphoma. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was necessary to further characterize the neoplastic round cells. The neoplastic cells had strongly membranous labeling for CD20 (), and there was a distinct nodularity appreciated to the neoplasm (, inset). The neoplastic cells also had variably positive nuclear labeling for Pax5 (not pictured), but they were negative for CD3 (), supporting a diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma.\\\\nAdditional histopathology samples were then sent to the Leukocyte Antigen Biology Laboratory at the University of California at Davis for a second opinion. The described nodularity seen on H&E (, inset) and the CD20 stain (, inset) was further characterized with IHC with a histiocyte marker, Iba-1. The nodules were composed of histiocytes and enriched infiltrates of T cells. Peripheral to those nodular aggregates, there were dense accumulations of large neoplastic (CD20+) B cells as described previously. The neoplastic B cells had a high proliferative fraction (80\\u201390% Ki-67 expression). PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) was performed, and the neoplastic B cells were demonstrated to be clonal (KDEv, or Kappa deleting element variable gene). Due to the unique nodularity of the neoplasm, the interpretation of the neoplasm with IHC and PARR results was large B-cell lymphoma with inflammation. This diagnosis was favored over a histiocyte and T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL) because the neoplastic B-cell population was more abundant than what is typically seen with TCRBCL.\\\\nThe patient remained in a partial remission and was continued on a CHOP-based protocol for the following 6 weeks; vinblastine was substituted for vincristine because of a national drug shortage. However, progressive disease was noted on the eighth week, characterized by an increase in size of the left retropharyngeal lymph node (3.1 \\u00d7 1.5 cm the previous week to 3.7 \\u00d7 2.4 cm the current week). The patient was switched to a CCNU rescue protocol. Three weeks after the start of this rescue protocol, the patient was euthanized due to worsening lethargy, inappetence, and dyspnea, as well as progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. A limited necropsy was performed with identification of multifocal widespread infiltrative disease within the retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes, kidneys, and liver. Histopathology of all of the tissues with identified lesions in PET/CT was not obtained. Similar to the hypoattenuated regions described in the PET/CT, the liver at necropsy had multifocal pale tan to red, firm masses ranging in size from 1 mm in diameter up to 5 cm \\u00d7 3.5 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm. Both kidneys had similar appearing masses within the renal cortex. Histopathology confirmed large-cell high-grade lymphoma within both retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes (), kidneys (), and liver ().\",\n          \"A 47-year-old female was referred to the hospital due to gradual abdominal enlargement accompanied by leg swelling lasting for 2 weeks. There was also a decrease in body weight about 10 kg in the last 8 months. The starting weight of the patient was 67 kg and reduced to 57 kg in the past 8 months. General weakness, pruritus, and decreased pubic and axillary hair were also noticeable. Eight months earlier, she had profound jaundice without abdominal pain. At that time, she got ursodeoxycholic acid and got better. After 2 months of treatment, the patient was lost to follow-up and never visited again to the hospital. She had no noteworthy medical or family history, including gastrointestinal bleeding or liver disease. On physical examination, the patient was alert, fully oriented, and the vital sign was stable. There were pale conjunctiva and icteric of the sclera. Her abdomen was round and soft with severe ascites. There was no abdominal tenderness. Mass or organomegaly was difficult to assess due to massive ascites. Bilateral pitting edema was present on both ankles.\\\\nInitial laboratory data are shown in Table ; it revealed that she had macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. The liver function test showed an increase in bilirubin level with mainly direct hyperbilirubinemia with an increase in AST and ALT with AST/ALT ratio >1. ALP and \\u03b3-GT levels were normal. Hemostatic functions showed an increase in both INR and APTT. Albumin levels were decreased with an increase in globulin levels. Renal function tests were still normal, and the results of hepatitis B and C were negative. Compared to the laboratory results from 8 months ago, the AST and ALT levels were higher and also the levels of bilirubin more severe compared to the present admission. However, there was no anemia nor thrombocytopenia documented 8 months ago. Ascites fluid analysis showed that the fluid was clear and yellow colored with low levels of protein, LDH, leukocyte, and erythrocyte. SAAG was <1.1 mg/dL. Cytology of ascetic fluid analysis found some polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells without malignant cells. The results of ascites fluid analysis are also shown in Table .\\\\nThe urinalysis result showed that there was moderate bilirubinuria, but no proteinuria was found. We also found mild urobilinogen in the urine. We already excluded the cause of hypoalbuminemia was due to nephrotic syndrome because no nephrotic-range proteinuria was found based on the examination of protein-creatinine ratio or albumin-creatinine ratio. Compared to the results from 8 months ago, the bilirubin and urobilinogen in the urine were milder in this admission with the other results similar. The urinalysis results are shown in Table .\\\\nAbdominal ultrasound examination (shown in Fig. ) showed ascites fluid in perivesical, perihepatic, perisplenic, hepatorenal fossa, and peri-intestine regions. No mass or organomegaly was found. Previous abdominal ultrasound from 8 months ago showed no ascites, but there was a thickening of the wall of the gall bladder without a sign of biliary obstruction. Because of the high level of globulin in this patient, we performed plasma protein electrophoresis in this patient. It showed a monoclonal gammopathy with an M spike in the gamma region with an increased level of \\u03b3-globulin. The result of plasma protein electrophoresis examination is shown in Figure .\\\\nWhile it is unfortunate that there was a lack of data regarding the bone marrow analysis in this patient, we found no sign of organ damage related to suspicion of multiple myeloma regarding the hypergammaglobulinemia in this patient. There were no lytic lesion from bone survey, hypercalcemia, or renal dysfunction from this patient. Because we suspected the possibility of autoimmunity in this patient, we found that there was an increased level of serum anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) by ELISA.\\\\nBased on the current data, the ascites was thought due to portal hypertension that might be caused by AIH. The patient was restricted for sodium intake and was given spironolactone 100 mg QD, furosemide 40 mg QD, ursodeoxycholic acid 250 mg b.i.d., and prednisone 60 mg/day. She also underwent large-volume paracentesis for the ascites followed by albumin transfusion. We also administered vitamin K injection and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma to correct the hemostasis function; however, there was no improvement regarding prolongation of INR and APTT.\\\\nClinical improvements were found for the ascites and the laboratory results after 1-week treatment. She visited the Gastroenterohepatology outpatient clinic 1 week later, and there was a clinical improvement for the ascites showed by the decrease in abdominal circumference with a decrease in body weight of 2 kg in 1 week. The monitoring of laboratory results is shown in Figure .\\\\nThe patient was planned to do magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy afterward. However, 1 week later, she visited the outpatient Gastroenterohepatology clinic. She had a sudden decrease of consciousness in the morning with the suspicion of stroke with intracranial hemorrhage. She died because of brain herniation due to the intracranial hemorrhage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1571,\n        \"min\": 2823,\n        \"max\": 30995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3807,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4938,\n          6231,\n          10853\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 238,\n        \"min\": 481,\n        \"max\": 4739,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 994,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1412,\n          754,\n          904\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The patient was first diagnosed with urethra adenocarcinoma 8 years ago. Total resection of the urinary bladder with lymphatic dissection was performed followed by combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One and a half-year after the first operation the patient was reoperated on for metastasis of the urethral adenocarcinoma and vulvectomy with left inguinal radical lymph node dissection was performed. The pathology report was in compliance with the first report of the urethral adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy. At the end of the same year the patient suffered a mass in her right thigh that caused a suspicion of another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy was performed and pathology specimens revealed malignant mesenchymal tumor. 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy was applied due to close neighbourhood of the tumor to the femoral artery and the tumor being larger than 5 centimeters in diameter. Following preoperative radiotherapy, wide resection of the tumor was performed. The pathology reports showed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma. The oncology consultation did not recommend postoperative chemotherapy, but 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy was applied.\\\\nFor the next three years the patient was regularly followed and no evidence of local or systemic relapse was present. The patient quit the routine control examinations and could not be followed until 4 months ago when MRI evaluation was performed for a mass in her left thigh. A subcutaneous lesion was detected in the left thigh with typical features of a lipoma. In addition, a large mass in the right femur was coincidentally observed with a satellite cutaneous nodule close to the previous incision scar (Figures and ). Tru-cut biopsy and PET scan were performed to grade the new lesion. The tru-cut biopsy has reported a low grade periosteal chondral tumor. An apical lesion of the right lung which was thought to be a metastasis was also present. MRI and CT angiographic evaluation showed the soft tissue component of the tumor enclosing the bone lesion 180 degrees medially and also involving a 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein ().\\\\nThe patient was reoperated on. Wide resection for the metastatic nodule of the skin was performed first and the frozen pathology reported it as a malignant mesenchymal tumor. The tumor of the right femur was also removed with wide resection including the involved 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein in the Hunter canal (). Frozen pathology results reported clean margins and the lesion being possibly periosteal chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The femoral artery and vein were reconstructed using saphenous vein from the left leg. Saphenous vein of the right leg was not used in order not to disturb both venous drainage systems of the same leg and to avoid a possible venous insufficiency postoperatively. The 22 cm long bony defect was reconstructed using a massive allograft of femur and plate-screw fixation of the proximal and distal osteotomy sites was performed following locked intramedullary nailing (). The docking sites were grafted with 10 cc of demineralized bone matrix each. Pathologic evaluation revealed the mass of the right femur to be a juxtacortical chondroblastic osteosarcoma and the soft tissue mass anterior to it to be an indifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the latter being in compliance with a relapse of the pleomorphic mesenchymal tumor that was resected in 2008. Pathologic evaluation of the resected dumbbell-shaped lesion of the left thigh revealed angiolipoma.\\\\nThroughout the routine radiologic evaluations and PET scan before surgery, a lesion in the right lung was also detected and was reported as a metastatic lesion (). Three weeks after the last surgery, thoracoscopy assisted wedge resection of the metastatic lesion was planned. At this time, the frozen biopsy displayed a primary adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung and the patient underwent a lobectomy.\",\n          \"An 8-year-old male neutered Domestic Long Hair cat was presented for a rapidly growing left ventral cervical mass. The mass was first noted 3 weeks prior to presentation, and fine needle aspiration and cytology performed by the primary care veterinarian was suggestive of lymphoma. At the time of presentation, the cat had no clinical signs associated with the large mass. The owner reported that 7 months prior, there was a similar growth on the opposite side of the neck, which, after an inconclusive cytology, resolved with empirical antibiotic and steroid treatment. The cat had no other pertinent past medical history besides occasional upper respiratory signs from suspected feline herpesvirus infection.\\\\nPhysical examination revealed a left ventral cervical mass (6.0 cm \\u00d7 3.9 cm), which was suspected to be an enlarged medial retropharyngeal lymph node. No other enlarged lymph nodes were detected on palpation. A grade 2/6 left-sided systolic heart murmur was also noted. Initial complete blood count and chemistry panel revealed no significant findings, and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)/Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) SNAP test were negative. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. An echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were recommended for further staging and to evaluate the extent of cardiac disease prior to general anesthesia but declined by the owner. Fine needle aspiration and cytology of the cervical mass revealed an expansion of large lymphocytes (~50%) with 50% small well-differentiated lymphocytes. There was also mild to moderate mixed inflammation (mild neutrophilic, moderate macrophagic). It is worthy to note that there was a lack of expansion of intermediate lymphocytes. These findings were concerning for lymphoma. Additional pertinent cytologic findings included mild plasma cell hyperplasia and mild to moderate mixed inflammation characterized by non-degenerate neutrophils and macrophages. Given the prolonged history of masses confined to the cervical region and cytology demonstrating persistence of a significant small lymphocyte population and mixed inflammation within the affected lymph node, Hodgkin's-like lymphoma was considered as a differential diagnosis in addition to high-grade lymphoma, despite the lack of characteristic Reed\\u2013Sternberg cells.\\\\nCross-sectional imaging was recommended to stage and plan for potential surgical removal of the cervical mass. Case timeline is presented in . The next day, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed under sedation (0.2 mg/kg butorphanol IV and 1.5 mg/kg alfaxalone IV), using a multidetector, 64-slice CT (GE Revolution EVO, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), at 120 kVp in a transverse plane (1.25-mm slice thickness) with pre-contrast and post-contrast imaging with 10 ml (240 mgI/ml) of iohexol administered IV. The scan included the skull, cervical region, and the cranial thorax. The CT showed a 4.1 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm \\u00d7 4.4 cm ovoid, hypoattenuating, heterogeneously and peripherally contrast enhancing soft tissue mass in the left ventral neck, causing rightward deviation of the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, and ventrolateral deviation of the left jugular vein. The mass was assumed to be the left medial retropharyngeal lymph node, as it was not seen otherwise. There was also enlargement, rounding, and contrast enhancement of the left superficial cervical lymph node (1.0 cm in diameter). Other findings from the CT included right caudal rhinitis and bilateral otitis media.\\\\nA full-body positron emission tomography\\u2013computed tomography (PET/CT) was performed to assess the extent of local and distant disease the following week. PET/CT was recommended in addition to CT for the cat to obtain more sensitive staging information prior to surgical lymph node extirpation, especially due to the additional enlarged left superficial cervical lymph node noted on CT. The cat was premedicated with butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IV); general anesthesia was induced with propofol (4 mg/kg IV) and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen delivered via a circle anesthetic breathing system. The cat was placed in prone position. Blood glucose prior to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) injection was 102 mg/dl. A dose of 9.25 MBq/kg (0.25 mCi/kg IV) of 18F-FDG was administered to the cat. The list mode time-of-flight raw data were acquired continuously on the Gemini 64 TF with Astonish (Philips, Cleveland, Ohio) PET/CT system. Two-millimeter isotropic voxel data sets [288 \\u00d7 288 matrix size using a 576 mm field of view (FOV)] and 180 s/bed were reconstructed using time-of-flight, three iterations, and 11 subsets. CT was acquired using the multi-slice system at 120 kVp and 150 mAs and reconstructed with a 4-mm slice thickness (512 \\u00d7 512 matrix size using 600 mm FOV) for attenuation correction and coregistration. A dynamic acquisition was performed over the body region starting with the 18F-FDG administration followed by a whole-body PET at 75 min post injection. The Philips Intellispace Portal was used to generate the images for subsequent case review and semi-quantitative assessment.\\\\nPET/CT () showed multiple enlarged 18F-FDG-avid lymph nodes (SUVmax left medial retropharyngeal 31.0; right medial retropharyngeal 4.5; left caudal cervical 19.5) and nodal masses in the neck, in addition to multiple 18F-FDG-avid regions in both lungs (SUVmax 4.4 and 6.8) and the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUVmax 10.6 and 17.6). There were single soft tissue nodules with focal surrounding unstructured interstitial opacities in the caudal lungs bilaterally which were not appreciated on the thoracic radiographs performed prior. The small bowel had a 18F-FDG-avid soft tissue nodule. The liver had multiple hypoattenuating lesions that were 18F-FDG-avid (SUVmax 17.9), and both renal cortices had multiple foci of abnormally increased 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax left kidney 16.7, right kidney 15.0). The spleen had no associated abnormal 18F-FDG uptake. The nasal cavity and nasopharynx had linear 18F-FDG activity with no definite CT abnormality (SUVmax 8.3). As a non-specific finding, it was interpreted as possibly inflammatory or infectious disease, or malignant involvement of the nasal soft tissues and adjacent osseous structures. There was mild 18F-FDG-avid partial opacification of the ethmoid sinuses (SUVmax 4.4) attributed to the underlying inflammatory sinus disease.\\\\nGiven the multifocal nature of the disease found on PET/CT, surgery was not pursued, and chemotherapy was recommended. The cat was started on a CHOP-based protocol () (\\u2013). A complete blood count was performed before every treatment to assess for myelosuppression and determine if the cat could receive chemotherapy. A physical examination before the first dose of chemotherapy confirmed a static 6.0 cm \\u00d7 3.9 cm left retropharyngeal lymph node and mildly enlarged left superficial cervical lymph node. The cat received vincristine (0.6 mg/m2) IV and ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg) IV and went home on prednisolone (1.9 mg/kg) PO once daily. Maropitant, metronidazole, and ondansetron were prescribed on an as-needed basis.\\\\nThe following week, physical examination revealed favorable response to the treatment; the left retropharyngeal lymph node was reduced in size (3.2 cm \\u00d7 1.5 cm), although the left superficial cervical lymph node remained mildly enlarged. The cat was sedated (8 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine IV and 0.2 mg/kg butorphanol IV) for the administration of another dose of vincristine (0.6 mg/m2) IV, as well as an incisional biopsy of the left retropharyngeal lymph node, due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis from the previously performed fine needle aspirate. The biopsy was submitted for histopathologic evaluation at The Ohio State University.\\\\nThe submitted sections of lymph node had an invasive, non-encapsulated, highly cellular neoplasm composed of sheets resting on collagenous stroma. On low power, the neoplasm had vague and indistinct outlines of nodules composed of fibrous connective tissue (, inset). Neoplastic cells were round, had distinct cell borders, had variable amounts of eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm, and had large, round to irregular nuclei with vesicular to finely stippled chromatin and one large, eosinophilic, distinct nucleoli (). Rare (less than five) cells had nuclei that appear to be bilobed or binucleated with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli (suspect Reed\\u2013Sternberg cells) (). Occasionally, neoplastic cells had a moderate amount of vacuolated cytoplasm or had little to no cytoplasm with a clear halo surrounding. Mitoses were 15 in 10 high-powered (400 \\u00d7) fields. There were rare pockets of small lymphocytes throughout the tissue section. A moderate number of neutrophils and histiocytes were interspersed throughout the neoplasm with multifocal regions of necrosis characterized by eosinophilic homogenous material admixed with pyknotic cellular debris.\\\\nThis biopsy was most consistent with a high-grade large-cell lymphoma. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was necessary to further characterize the neoplastic round cells. The neoplastic cells had strongly membranous labeling for CD20 (), and there was a distinct nodularity appreciated to the neoplasm (, inset). The neoplastic cells also had variably positive nuclear labeling for Pax5 (not pictured), but they were negative for CD3 (), supporting a diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma.\\\\nAdditional histopathology samples were then sent to the Leukocyte Antigen Biology Laboratory at the University of California at Davis for a second opinion. The described nodularity seen on H&E (, inset) and the CD20 stain (, inset) was further characterized with IHC with a histiocyte marker, Iba-1. The nodules were composed of histiocytes and enriched infiltrates of T cells. Peripheral to those nodular aggregates, there were dense accumulations of large neoplastic (CD20+) B cells as described previously. The neoplastic B cells had a high proliferative fraction (80\\u201390% Ki-67 expression). PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) was performed, and the neoplastic B cells were demonstrated to be clonal (KDEv, or Kappa deleting element variable gene). Due to the unique nodularity of the neoplasm, the interpretation of the neoplasm with IHC and PARR results was large B-cell lymphoma with inflammation. This diagnosis was favored over a histiocyte and T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL) because the neoplastic B-cell population was more abundant than what is typically seen with TCRBCL.\\\\nThe patient remained in a partial remission and was continued on a CHOP-based protocol for the following 6 weeks; vinblastine was substituted for vincristine because of a national drug shortage. However, progressive disease was noted on the eighth week, characterized by an increase in size of the left retropharyngeal lymph node (3.1 \\u00d7 1.5 cm the previous week to 3.7 \\u00d7 2.4 cm the current week). The patient was switched to a CCNU rescue protocol. Three weeks after the start of this rescue protocol, the patient was euthanized due to worsening lethargy, inappetence, and dyspnea, as well as progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. A limited necropsy was performed with identification of multifocal widespread infiltrative disease within the retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes, kidneys, and liver. Histopathology of all of the tissues with identified lesions in PET/CT was not obtained. Similar to the hypoattenuated regions described in the PET/CT, the liver at necropsy had multifocal pale tan to red, firm masses ranging in size from 1 mm in diameter up to 5 cm \\u00d7 3.5 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm. Both kidneys had similar appearing masses within the renal cortex. Histopathology confirmed large-cell high-grade lymphoma within both retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes (), kidneys (), and liver ().\",\n          \"A 47-year-old female was referred to the hospital due to gradual abdominal enlargement accompanied by leg swelling lasting for 2 weeks. There was also a decrease in body weight about 10 kg in the last 8 months. The starting weight of the patient was 67 kg and reduced to 57 kg in the past 8 months. General weakness, pruritus, and decreased pubic and axillary hair were also noticeable. Eight months earlier, she had profound jaundice without abdominal pain. At that time, she got ursodeoxycholic acid and got better. After 2 months of treatment, the patient was lost to follow-up and never visited again to the hospital. She had no noteworthy medical or family history, including gastrointestinal bleeding or liver disease. On physical examination, the patient was alert, fully oriented, and the vital sign was stable. There were pale conjunctiva and icteric of the sclera. Her abdomen was round and soft with severe ascites. There was no abdominal tenderness. Mass or organomegaly was difficult to assess due to massive ascites. Bilateral pitting edema was present on both ankles.\\\\nInitial laboratory data are shown in Table ; it revealed that she had macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. The liver function test showed an increase in bilirubin level with mainly direct hyperbilirubinemia with an increase in AST and ALT with AST/ALT ratio >1. ALP and \\u03b3-GT levels were normal. Hemostatic functions showed an increase in both INR and APTT. Albumin levels were decreased with an increase in globulin levels. Renal function tests were still normal, and the results of hepatitis B and C were negative. Compared to the laboratory results from 8 months ago, the AST and ALT levels were higher and also the levels of bilirubin more severe compared to the present admission. However, there was no anemia nor thrombocytopenia documented 8 months ago. Ascites fluid analysis showed that the fluid was clear and yellow colored with low levels of protein, LDH, leukocyte, and erythrocyte. SAAG was <1.1 mg/dL. Cytology of ascetic fluid analysis found some polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells without malignant cells. The results of ascites fluid analysis are also shown in Table .\\\\nThe urinalysis result showed that there was moderate bilirubinuria, but no proteinuria was found. We also found mild urobilinogen in the urine. We already excluded the cause of hypoalbuminemia was due to nephrotic syndrome because no nephrotic-range proteinuria was found based on the examination of protein-creatinine ratio or albumin-creatinine ratio. Compared to the results from 8 months ago, the bilirubin and urobilinogen in the urine were milder in this admission with the other results similar. The urinalysis results are shown in Table .\\\\nAbdominal ultrasound examination (shown in Fig. ) showed ascites fluid in perivesical, perihepatic, perisplenic, hepatorenal fossa, and peri-intestine regions. No mass or organomegaly was found. Previous abdominal ultrasound from 8 months ago showed no ascites, but there was a thickening of the wall of the gall bladder without a sign of biliary obstruction. Because of the high level of globulin in this patient, we performed plasma protein electrophoresis in this patient. It showed a monoclonal gammopathy with an M spike in the gamma region with an increased level of \\u03b3-globulin. The result of plasma protein electrophoresis examination is shown in Figure .\\\\nWhile it is unfortunate that there was a lack of data regarding the bone marrow analysis in this patient, we found no sign of organ damage related to suspicion of multiple myeloma regarding the hypergammaglobulinemia in this patient. There were no lytic lesion from bone survey, hypercalcemia, or renal dysfunction from this patient. Because we suspected the possibility of autoimmunity in this patient, we found that there was an increased level of serum anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) by ELISA.\\\\nBased on the current data, the ascites was thought due to portal hypertension that might be caused by AIH. The patient was restricted for sodium intake and was given spironolactone 100 mg QD, furosemide 40 mg QD, ursodeoxycholic acid 250 mg b.i.d., and prednisone 60 mg/day. She also underwent large-volume paracentesis for the ascites followed by albumin transfusion. We also administered vitamin K injection and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma to correct the hemostasis function; however, there was no improvement regarding prolongation of INR and APTT.\\\\nClinical improvements were found for the ascites and the laboratory results after 1-week treatment. She visited the Gastroenterohepatology outpatient clinic 1 week later, and there was a clinical improvement for the ascites showed by the decrease in abdominal circumference with a decrease in body weight of 2 kg in 1 week. The monitoring of laboratory results is shown in Figure .\\\\nThe patient was planned to do magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy afterward. However, 1 week later, she visited the outpatient Gastroenterohepatology clinic. She had a sudden decrease of consciousness in the morning with the suspicion of stroke with intracranial hemorrhage. She died because of brain herniation due to the intracranial hemorrhage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1571,\n        \"min\": 2823,\n        \"max\": 30995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3807,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4938,\n          6231,\n          10853\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 238,\n        \"min\": 481,\n        \"max\": 4739,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 994,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1412,\n          754,\n          904\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"anchors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"positives\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"anchor_positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The patient was first diagnosed with urethra adenocarcinoma 8 years ago. Total resection of the urinary bladder with lymphatic dissection was performed followed by combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One and a half-year after the first operation the patient was reoperated on for metastasis of the urethral adenocarcinoma and vulvectomy with left inguinal radical lymph node dissection was performed. The pathology report was in compliance with the first report of the urethral adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient received 54 Gy/30 fraction radiotherapy. At the end of the same year the patient suffered a mass in her right thigh that caused a suspicion of another metastasis. Tru-cut biopsy was performed and pathology specimens revealed malignant mesenchymal tumor. 28 Gy/8 fraction preoperative radiotherapy was applied due to close neighbourhood of the tumor to the femoral artery and the tumor being larger than 5 centimeters in diameter. Following preoperative radiotherapy, wide resection of the tumor was performed. The pathology reports showed a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma. The oncology consultation did not recommend postoperative chemotherapy, but 20 Gy/10 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy was applied.\\\\nFor the next three years the patient was regularly followed and no evidence of local or systemic relapse was present. The patient quit the routine control examinations and could not be followed until 4 months ago when MRI evaluation was performed for a mass in her left thigh. A subcutaneous lesion was detected in the left thigh with typical features of a lipoma. In addition, a large mass in the right femur was coincidentally observed with a satellite cutaneous nodule close to the previous incision scar (Figures and ). Tru-cut biopsy and PET scan were performed to grade the new lesion. The tru-cut biopsy has reported a low grade periosteal chondral tumor. An apical lesion of the right lung which was thought to be a metastasis was also present. MRI and CT angiographic evaluation showed the soft tissue component of the tumor enclosing the bone lesion 180 degrees medially and also involving a 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein ().\\\\nThe patient was reoperated on. Wide resection for the metastatic nodule of the skin was performed first and the frozen pathology reported it as a malignant mesenchymal tumor. The tumor of the right femur was also removed with wide resection including the involved 10 cm segment of the femoral artery and vein in the Hunter canal (). Frozen pathology results reported clean margins and the lesion being possibly periosteal chondroblastic osteosarcoma. The femoral artery and vein were reconstructed using saphenous vein from the left leg. Saphenous vein of the right leg was not used in order not to disturb both venous drainage systems of the same leg and to avoid a possible venous insufficiency postoperatively. The 22 cm long bony defect was reconstructed using a massive allograft of femur and plate-screw fixation of the proximal and distal osteotomy sites was performed following locked intramedullary nailing (). The docking sites were grafted with 10 cc of demineralized bone matrix each. Pathologic evaluation revealed the mass of the right femur to be a juxtacortical chondroblastic osteosarcoma and the soft tissue mass anterior to it to be an indifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the latter being in compliance with a relapse of the pleomorphic mesenchymal tumor that was resected in 2008. Pathologic evaluation of the resected dumbbell-shaped lesion of the left thigh revealed angiolipoma.\\\\nThroughout the routine radiologic evaluations and PET scan before surgery, a lesion in the right lung was also detected and was reported as a metastatic lesion (). Three weeks after the last surgery, thoracoscopy assisted wedge resection of the metastatic lesion was planned. At this time, the frozen biopsy displayed a primary adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung and the patient underwent a lobectomy.\",\n          \"An 8-year-old male neutered Domestic Long Hair cat was presented for a rapidly growing left ventral cervical mass. The mass was first noted 3 weeks prior to presentation, and fine needle aspiration and cytology performed by the primary care veterinarian was suggestive of lymphoma. At the time of presentation, the cat had no clinical signs associated with the large mass. The owner reported that 7 months prior, there was a similar growth on the opposite side of the neck, which, after an inconclusive cytology, resolved with empirical antibiotic and steroid treatment. The cat had no other pertinent past medical history besides occasional upper respiratory signs from suspected feline herpesvirus infection.\\\\nPhysical examination revealed a left ventral cervical mass (6.0 cm \\u00d7 3.9 cm), which was suspected to be an enlarged medial retropharyngeal lymph node. No other enlarged lymph nodes were detected on palpation. A grade 2/6 left-sided systolic heart murmur was also noted. Initial complete blood count and chemistry panel revealed no significant findings, and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)/Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) SNAP test were negative. Thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. An echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound were recommended for further staging and to evaluate the extent of cardiac disease prior to general anesthesia but declined by the owner. Fine needle aspiration and cytology of the cervical mass revealed an expansion of large lymphocytes (~50%) with 50% small well-differentiated lymphocytes. There was also mild to moderate mixed inflammation (mild neutrophilic, moderate macrophagic). It is worthy to note that there was a lack of expansion of intermediate lymphocytes. These findings were concerning for lymphoma. Additional pertinent cytologic findings included mild plasma cell hyperplasia and mild to moderate mixed inflammation characterized by non-degenerate neutrophils and macrophages. Given the prolonged history of masses confined to the cervical region and cytology demonstrating persistence of a significant small lymphocyte population and mixed inflammation within the affected lymph node, Hodgkin's-like lymphoma was considered as a differential diagnosis in addition to high-grade lymphoma, despite the lack of characteristic Reed\\u2013Sternberg cells.\\\\nCross-sectional imaging was recommended to stage and plan for potential surgical removal of the cervical mass. Case timeline is presented in . The next day, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed under sedation (0.2 mg/kg butorphanol IV and 1.5 mg/kg alfaxalone IV), using a multidetector, 64-slice CT (GE Revolution EVO, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), at 120 kVp in a transverse plane (1.25-mm slice thickness) with pre-contrast and post-contrast imaging with 10 ml (240 mgI/ml) of iohexol administered IV. The scan included the skull, cervical region, and the cranial thorax. The CT showed a 4.1 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm \\u00d7 4.4 cm ovoid, hypoattenuating, heterogeneously and peripherally contrast enhancing soft tissue mass in the left ventral neck, causing rightward deviation of the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, and ventrolateral deviation of the left jugular vein. The mass was assumed to be the left medial retropharyngeal lymph node, as it was not seen otherwise. There was also enlargement, rounding, and contrast enhancement of the left superficial cervical lymph node (1.0 cm in diameter). Other findings from the CT included right caudal rhinitis and bilateral otitis media.\\\\nA full-body positron emission tomography\\u2013computed tomography (PET/CT) was performed to assess the extent of local and distant disease the following week. PET/CT was recommended in addition to CT for the cat to obtain more sensitive staging information prior to surgical lymph node extirpation, especially due to the additional enlarged left superficial cervical lymph node noted on CT. The cat was premedicated with butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IV); general anesthesia was induced with propofol (4 mg/kg IV) and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen delivered via a circle anesthetic breathing system. The cat was placed in prone position. Blood glucose prior to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) injection was 102 mg/dl. A dose of 9.25 MBq/kg (0.25 mCi/kg IV) of 18F-FDG was administered to the cat. The list mode time-of-flight raw data were acquired continuously on the Gemini 64 TF with Astonish (Philips, Cleveland, Ohio) PET/CT system. Two-millimeter isotropic voxel data sets [288 \\u00d7 288 matrix size using a 576 mm field of view (FOV)] and 180 s/bed were reconstructed using time-of-flight, three iterations, and 11 subsets. CT was acquired using the multi-slice system at 120 kVp and 150 mAs and reconstructed with a 4-mm slice thickness (512 \\u00d7 512 matrix size using 600 mm FOV) for attenuation correction and coregistration. A dynamic acquisition was performed over the body region starting with the 18F-FDG administration followed by a whole-body PET at 75 min post injection. The Philips Intellispace Portal was used to generate the images for subsequent case review and semi-quantitative assessment.\\\\nPET/CT () showed multiple enlarged 18F-FDG-avid lymph nodes (SUVmax left medial retropharyngeal 31.0; right medial retropharyngeal 4.5; left caudal cervical 19.5) and nodal masses in the neck, in addition to multiple 18F-FDG-avid regions in both lungs (SUVmax 4.4 and 6.8) and the mediastinal lymph nodes (SUVmax 10.6 and 17.6). There were single soft tissue nodules with focal surrounding unstructured interstitial opacities in the caudal lungs bilaterally which were not appreciated on the thoracic radiographs performed prior. The small bowel had a 18F-FDG-avid soft tissue nodule. The liver had multiple hypoattenuating lesions that were 18F-FDG-avid (SUVmax 17.9), and both renal cortices had multiple foci of abnormally increased 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax left kidney 16.7, right kidney 15.0). The spleen had no associated abnormal 18F-FDG uptake. The nasal cavity and nasopharynx had linear 18F-FDG activity with no definite CT abnormality (SUVmax 8.3). As a non-specific finding, it was interpreted as possibly inflammatory or infectious disease, or malignant involvement of the nasal soft tissues and adjacent osseous structures. There was mild 18F-FDG-avid partial opacification of the ethmoid sinuses (SUVmax 4.4) attributed to the underlying inflammatory sinus disease.\\\\nGiven the multifocal nature of the disease found on PET/CT, surgery was not pursued, and chemotherapy was recommended. The cat was started on a CHOP-based protocol () (\\u2013). A complete blood count was performed before every treatment to assess for myelosuppression and determine if the cat could receive chemotherapy. A physical examination before the first dose of chemotherapy confirmed a static 6.0 cm \\u00d7 3.9 cm left retropharyngeal lymph node and mildly enlarged left superficial cervical lymph node. The cat received vincristine (0.6 mg/m2) IV and ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg) IV and went home on prednisolone (1.9 mg/kg) PO once daily. Maropitant, metronidazole, and ondansetron were prescribed on an as-needed basis.\\\\nThe following week, physical examination revealed favorable response to the treatment; the left retropharyngeal lymph node was reduced in size (3.2 cm \\u00d7 1.5 cm), although the left superficial cervical lymph node remained mildly enlarged. The cat was sedated (8 mcg/kg dexmedetomidine IV and 0.2 mg/kg butorphanol IV) for the administration of another dose of vincristine (0.6 mg/m2) IV, as well as an incisional biopsy of the left retropharyngeal lymph node, due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis from the previously performed fine needle aspirate. The biopsy was submitted for histopathologic evaluation at The Ohio State University.\\\\nThe submitted sections of lymph node had an invasive, non-encapsulated, highly cellular neoplasm composed of sheets resting on collagenous stroma. On low power, the neoplasm had vague and indistinct outlines of nodules composed of fibrous connective tissue (, inset). Neoplastic cells were round, had distinct cell borders, had variable amounts of eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm, and had large, round to irregular nuclei with vesicular to finely stippled chromatin and one large, eosinophilic, distinct nucleoli (). Rare (less than five) cells had nuclei that appear to be bilobed or binucleated with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli (suspect Reed\\u2013Sternberg cells) (). Occasionally, neoplastic cells had a moderate amount of vacuolated cytoplasm or had little to no cytoplasm with a clear halo surrounding. Mitoses were 15 in 10 high-powered (400 \\u00d7) fields. There were rare pockets of small lymphocytes throughout the tissue section. A moderate number of neutrophils and histiocytes were interspersed throughout the neoplasm with multifocal regions of necrosis characterized by eosinophilic homogenous material admixed with pyknotic cellular debris.\\\\nThis biopsy was most consistent with a high-grade large-cell lymphoma. However, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was necessary to further characterize the neoplastic round cells. The neoplastic cells had strongly membranous labeling for CD20 (), and there was a distinct nodularity appreciated to the neoplasm (, inset). The neoplastic cells also had variably positive nuclear labeling for Pax5 (not pictured), but they were negative for CD3 (), supporting a diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma.\\\\nAdditional histopathology samples were then sent to the Leukocyte Antigen Biology Laboratory at the University of California at Davis for a second opinion. The described nodularity seen on H&E (, inset) and the CD20 stain (, inset) was further characterized with IHC with a histiocyte marker, Iba-1. The nodules were composed of histiocytes and enriched infiltrates of T cells. Peripheral to those nodular aggregates, there were dense accumulations of large neoplastic (CD20+) B cells as described previously. The neoplastic B cells had a high proliferative fraction (80\\u201390% Ki-67 expression). PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR) was performed, and the neoplastic B cells were demonstrated to be clonal (KDEv, or Kappa deleting element variable gene). Due to the unique nodularity of the neoplasm, the interpretation of the neoplasm with IHC and PARR results was large B-cell lymphoma with inflammation. This diagnosis was favored over a histiocyte and T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL) because the neoplastic B-cell population was more abundant than what is typically seen with TCRBCL.\\\\nThe patient remained in a partial remission and was continued on a CHOP-based protocol for the following 6 weeks; vinblastine was substituted for vincristine because of a national drug shortage. However, progressive disease was noted on the eighth week, characterized by an increase in size of the left retropharyngeal lymph node (3.1 \\u00d7 1.5 cm the previous week to 3.7 \\u00d7 2.4 cm the current week). The patient was switched to a CCNU rescue protocol. Three weeks after the start of this rescue protocol, the patient was euthanized due to worsening lethargy, inappetence, and dyspnea, as well as progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. A limited necropsy was performed with identification of multifocal widespread infiltrative disease within the retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes, kidneys, and liver. Histopathology of all of the tissues with identified lesions in PET/CT was not obtained. Similar to the hypoattenuated regions described in the PET/CT, the liver at necropsy had multifocal pale tan to red, firm masses ranging in size from 1 mm in diameter up to 5 cm \\u00d7 3.5 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm. Both kidneys had similar appearing masses within the renal cortex. Histopathology confirmed large-cell high-grade lymphoma within both retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes (), kidneys (), and liver ().\",\n          \"A 47-year-old female was referred to the hospital due to gradual abdominal enlargement accompanied by leg swelling lasting for 2 weeks. There was also a decrease in body weight about 10 kg in the last 8 months. The starting weight of the patient was 67 kg and reduced to 57 kg in the past 8 months. General weakness, pruritus, and decreased pubic and axillary hair were also noticeable. Eight months earlier, she had profound jaundice without abdominal pain. At that time, she got ursodeoxycholic acid and got better. After 2 months of treatment, the patient was lost to follow-up and never visited again to the hospital. She had no noteworthy medical or family history, including gastrointestinal bleeding or liver disease. On physical examination, the patient was alert, fully oriented, and the vital sign was stable. There were pale conjunctiva and icteric of the sclera. Her abdomen was round and soft with severe ascites. There was no abdominal tenderness. Mass or organomegaly was difficult to assess due to massive ascites. Bilateral pitting edema was present on both ankles.\\\\nInitial laboratory data are shown in Table ; it revealed that she had macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. The liver function test showed an increase in bilirubin level with mainly direct hyperbilirubinemia with an increase in AST and ALT with AST/ALT ratio >1. ALP and \\u03b3-GT levels were normal. Hemostatic functions showed an increase in both INR and APTT. Albumin levels were decreased with an increase in globulin levels. Renal function tests were still normal, and the results of hepatitis B and C were negative. Compared to the laboratory results from 8 months ago, the AST and ALT levels were higher and also the levels of bilirubin more severe compared to the present admission. However, there was no anemia nor thrombocytopenia documented 8 months ago. Ascites fluid analysis showed that the fluid was clear and yellow colored with low levels of protein, LDH, leukocyte, and erythrocyte. SAAG was <1.1 mg/dL. Cytology of ascetic fluid analysis found some polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells without malignant cells. The results of ascites fluid analysis are also shown in Table .\\\\nThe urinalysis result showed that there was moderate bilirubinuria, but no proteinuria was found. We also found mild urobilinogen in the urine. We already excluded the cause of hypoalbuminemia was due to nephrotic syndrome because no nephrotic-range proteinuria was found based on the examination of protein-creatinine ratio or albumin-creatinine ratio. Compared to the results from 8 months ago, the bilirubin and urobilinogen in the urine were milder in this admission with the other results similar. The urinalysis results are shown in Table .\\\\nAbdominal ultrasound examination (shown in Fig. ) showed ascites fluid in perivesical, perihepatic, perisplenic, hepatorenal fossa, and peri-intestine regions. No mass or organomegaly was found. Previous abdominal ultrasound from 8 months ago showed no ascites, but there was a thickening of the wall of the gall bladder without a sign of biliary obstruction. Because of the high level of globulin in this patient, we performed plasma protein electrophoresis in this patient. It showed a monoclonal gammopathy with an M spike in the gamma region with an increased level of \\u03b3-globulin. The result of plasma protein electrophoresis examination is shown in Figure .\\\\nWhile it is unfortunate that there was a lack of data regarding the bone marrow analysis in this patient, we found no sign of organ damage related to suspicion of multiple myeloma regarding the hypergammaglobulinemia in this patient. There were no lytic lesion from bone survey, hypercalcemia, or renal dysfunction from this patient. Because we suspected the possibility of autoimmunity in this patient, we found that there was an increased level of serum anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) by ELISA.\\\\nBased on the current data, the ascites was thought due to portal hypertension that might be caused by AIH. The patient was restricted for sodium intake and was given spironolactone 100 mg QD, furosemide 40 mg QD, ursodeoxycholic acid 250 mg b.i.d., and prednisone 60 mg/day. She also underwent large-volume paracentesis for the ascites followed by albumin transfusion. We also administered vitamin K injection and transfusion of fresh frozen plasma to correct the hemostasis function; however, there was no improvement regarding prolongation of INR and APTT.\\\\nClinical improvements were found for the ascites and the laboratory results after 1-week treatment. She visited the Gastroenterohepatology outpatient clinic 1 week later, and there was a clinical improvement for the ascites showed by the decrease in abdominal circumference with a decrease in body weight of 2 kg in 1 week. The monitoring of laboratory results is shown in Figure .\\\\nThe patient was planned to do magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy afterward. However, 1 week later, she visited the outpatient Gastroenterohepatology clinic. She had a sudden decrease of consciousness in the morning with the suspicion of stroke with intracranial hemorrhage. She died because of brain herniation due to the intracranial hemorrhage.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1571,\n        \"min\": 2823,\n        \"max\": 30995,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3807,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4938,\n          6231,\n          10853\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 238,\n        \"min\": 481,\n        \"max\": 4739,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 994,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1412,\n          754,\n          904\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"anchors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"positives\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"anchor_positive\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 44022,\n        \"samples\": [\n          [\n            \"the age of twenty-one he was struck by a motor vehicle and sustained multiple fractures as well as a significant degloving injury to his distal left lower extremity.
